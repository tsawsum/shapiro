While we wait, we boogie down!
My hair is getting soft!

Lyrics:
Down by the pond 
Where the tadpoles grow 
Frogs hop and jump 
They go go go! 
With a boing, spring, splish splash, splosh
Straight in the water with a swishaty-swash! 

Big brother‚Äôs strong
He hops on by
But little tadpole 
Can‚Äôt jump that high  
 
With a boing, spring, hip, hap, hop
Hop in the air with a flippity flop!

Big sister‚Äôs strong 
She hops on by
But little tadpole 
Can‚Äôt jump that high

With a boing, spring, hip, hap, hop
Hop in the air with a flippity flop!

Down by the pond 
Where the tadpoles grow 
Frogs hop and jump 
They go go go! 
(SINGSONG) With a boing, spring, splish splash, splosh, straight in the water with a swishaty-swash! 

It's fun to jump 
Just like a frog 
They hop and jump  
From log to log 

Down by the pond 
Where the tadpoles grow 
I'll tell you what
You did not know! 
This great big frog
Was a tadpole too! 
(SINGSONG) It grew long legs, it grew and grew! 
Grew big and strong and you will too!

This tadpole‚Äôs small
But he will grow
So big and tall,
And go, go, go! 


With a boing, spring, hip, hap, hop
Hop in the air with a flippity flop!

Verse 1
Let‚Äôs pretend
We‚Äôve got a magic friend
Oh it could be a unicorn!
A sparkly horn
My lovely unicorn
Oh here she is, my unicorn!

Hey let‚Äôs fly to the sky
Come with me on a magical ride
Hey let‚Äôs fly side by side
Come with me on a unicorn ride!
Verse 2
Rainbow fur
It looks so good on her
My magic friend, my unicorn
We can soar
And glide and swoop and more
When we are with our unicorns
Chorus 2
Hey let‚Äôs fly
To the sky
Come with me on a magical ride
Hey let‚Äôs fly
Side by side
Come with me on a unicorn ride!
Verse 3
We can fly
Right through the starry sky

When we are on our unicorns
Come with me
Through all the galaxies
So magical, with our unicorns
Chorus 3
Hey let‚Äôs fly (Let‚Äôs fly!)

Lyrics:
Down by the pond 
Where the tadpoles grow 
Frogs hop and jump 
They go go go! 
With a boing, spring, splish splash, splosh
Straight in the water with a swishaty-swash! 

Big brother‚Äôs strong
He hops on by
But little tadpole 
Can‚Äôt jump that high  
 
With a boing, spring, hip, hap, hop
Hop in the air with a flippity flop!

Big sister‚Äôs strong 
She hops on by
But little tadpole 
Can‚Äôt jump that high

With a boing, spring, hip, hap, hop
Hop in the air with a flippity flop!

Down by the pond 
Where the tadpoles grow 
Frogs hop and jump 
They go go go! 
(SINGSONG) With a boing, spring, splish splash, splosh, straight in the water with a swishaty-swash! 

It's fun to jump 
Just like a frog 
They hop and jump  
From log to log 

Down by the pond 
Where the tadpoles grow 
I'll tell you what
You did not know! 
This great big frog
Was a tadpole too! 
(SINGSONG) It grew long legs, it grew and grew! 
Grew big and strong and you will too!

This tadpole‚Äôs small
But he will grow
So big and tall,
And go, go, go! 


With a boing, spring, hip, hap, hop
Hop in the air with a flippity flop!

Verse 1
Let‚Äôs pretend
We‚Äôve got a magic friend
Oh it could be a unicorn!
A sparkly horn
My lovely unicorn
Oh here she is, my unicorn!
Chorus 1
Hey let‚Äôs fly to the sky
Come with me on a magical ride
Hey let‚Äôs fly side by side
Come with me on a unicorn ride!
Verse 2
Rainbow fur
It looks so good on her
My magic friend, my unicorn
We can soar
And glide and swoop and more
When we are with our unicorns
Chorus 2
Hey let‚Äôs fly
To the sky
Come with me on a magical ride
Hey let‚Äôs fly
Side by side
Come with me on a unicorn ride!
Verse 3
We can fly
Right through the starry sky

When we are on our unicorns
Come with me
Through all the galaxies
So magical, with our unicorns
Chorus 3
Hey let‚Äôs fly (Let‚Äôs fly!)
To the sky (the sky!)
Come with me on a magical ride
Hey let‚Äôs fly (let‚Äôs fly!)
Side by side (let‚Äôs ride!)

JJ and friends show their Christmas spirit by dancing to the classic tune ‚ÄúDeck the Halls.‚Äù
Lyrics: 
Deck the hall with boughs of holly,
Fa la la la la la la la la.
'Tis the season to be jolly,
Fa la la la la la la la la.
Don we now our gay apparel,
Fa la la la la la la la la.
Troll the ancient Yuletide carol,
Fa la la la la la la la la.

See the blazing Yule before us,
Fa la la la la la la la la.
Strike the harp and join the chorus,
Fa la la la la la la la la.
Follow me in merry measure,
Fa la la la la la la la la.
While I tell of Yuletide treasure,
Fa la la la la la la la la.

Fast away the old year passes,
Fa la la la la la la la la.
Hail the new, ye lads and lasses,
Fa la la la la la la la la.
Sing we joyous all together,
Fa la la la la la la la la.
Heedless of the wind and weather,
Fa la la la la la la la la.

Lyrics: 
CHORUS
When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
They‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre healthy
In every way
VERSE 1
They‚Äôll check your mouth,
they‚Äôll check your head
They‚Äôll check your temperature,
step by step
CHORUS
When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
They‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre healthy
In every way
VERSE 2
They‚Äôll check your lungs
they‚Äôll check your heart
They‚Äôll make sure they‚Äôre working
every part
CHORUS
When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today

They‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre healthy
In every way
VERSE 3
They‚Äôll check your eyes,
they‚Äôll check your ears
They‚Äôll check how well
You can see and hear
CHORUS
When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
They‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre healthy
In every way
VERSE 4
They‚Äôll check your tongue,
they‚Äôll check your throat
They‚Äôll look at their checklist
and make some notes
CHORUS
When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
They‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre healthy
In every way
VERSE 5
They‚Äôll check your reflex,
they‚Äôll check your bones
To see that they‚Äôre healthy
and how much you‚Äôve grown
CHORUS
When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
They‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre healthy
In every way
VERSE 6
Now they might say
that you need a shot
But don‚Äôt be scared,
it won‚Äôt hurt a lot

CHORUS
When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
They‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre healthy
In every way

Lyrics: 
The wheels on the bus go round and round
Round and round
Round and round
The wheels on the bus go round and round
All through the town

The doors on the bus go open and shut
Open and shut
Open and shut
The doors on the bus go open and shut
All through the town

The wipers on the bus go swish, swish, swish
Swish, swish, swish
Swish, swish, swish
The wipers on the bus go swish, swish, swish
All through the town

The horn on the bus goes beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep
The horn on the bus goes beep, beep, beep
All through the town

The signals on the bus go 
Blink, blink, blink
Blink, blink, blink
The signals on the bus go blink, blink, blink
All through the town

The people on the bus go up and down
Up and down
Up and down
The people on the bus go up and down
All through the town

The brakes on the bus go
Squeak, squeak, squeak, 
Squeak, squeak, squeak, 
The brakes on the bus go squeak, squeak, squeak
All through the town

The wheels on the bus go round and round
Round and round
Round and round
The wheels on the bus go round and round
All through the town

The parents in the crowd say
I'm so proud, I'm so proud, I'm so proud
The parents in the crowd say I'm so proud
Now take a bow

Lyrics:
VERSE 1
The wheels on the truck go round and round,
Round and round,
Round and round,
The wheels on the truck go round and round,
All through the town.

VERSE 2
The horn on the truck goes beep, beep, beep,
Beep, beep, beep,
Beep, beep, beep,
The horn on the truck goes beep, beep, beep
All through the town.

VERSE 3
The driver on the truck waves Hi! Hi! Hi!
Hi, Hi, Hi!
Hi, Hi, Hi!
The driver on the truck waves hello,
All through the town.

VERSE 4
The arm on the truck goes lift, lift, lift,

Lift, lift, lift,
Lift, lift, lift,
The arm on the truck goes lift, lift, lift,
All through the town.

VERSE 5
The recycling on the truck goes clink, clink, clink,
Clink, clink, clink,
Clink, clink, clink,
The recycling on the truck goes clink, clink, clink,
All through the town.

VERSE 6
The compactor on the truck goes crunch, crunch, crunch,
Crunch, crunch, crunch,
Crunch, crunch, crunch,
The compactor on the truck goes crunch, crunch, crunch,
All through the town.

VERSE 7
The door on the truck goes open and shut,
Open and shut,
Open and shut,
The door on the truck goes open and shut,
All through the town.

VERSE 8

The driver on the truck goes ‚ÄúHere you go‚Äù,
‚ÄúHere you go‚Äù,
‚ÄúHere you go‚Äù,
The driver on the truck goes ‚ÄúHere you go‚Äù,
All through the town.

VERSE 9
The wheels on the truck go round and round,
Round and round,
Round and round,
The wheels on the truck go round and round,
All through the town.

Lyrics:
Oh I‚Äôm gonna catch that bubble yes I will (yes you will)
Oh I‚Äôm gonna catch that bubble yes I will (yes you will)
You may giggle you may chuckle
Every time I pop the bubble
But I‚Äôm gonna catch that bubble yes I will

Oh I‚Äôm gonna jump and get it yes I will (yes you will)
Oh I‚Äôm gonna jump and get it yes I will (yes you will)
You may giggle you may chuckle
Every time I pop the bubble
But I‚Äôm gonna catch that bubble yes I will

High and low, high and low!
Watch those bubbles, go, go, go,
We can do it, we won't stop
Watch out if they pop pop pop

Oh I‚Äôm gonna sneak behind it yes I will (yes you will)
Oh I‚Äôm gonna sneak behind it yes I will (yes you will)
You may giggle you may chuckle

Oh I‚Äôm gonna set a trap oh yes I will (yes I will)
Oh I‚Äôm gonna set a trap oh yes I will (yes I will)

Watch those bubbles, go go go
We can do it, we won't stop
Watch out if they pop pop pop

Oh at last I caught that bubble yes I did (yes you did)
Oh at last I caught that bubble yes I did (yes you did)
No more giggles, no more chuckles
Cause now I‚Äôve got a bubble
At last I caught that bubble yes I did (yes you did)

Watch those bubbles, go go go
We can do it, we won't stop
Watch out if they pop pop pop

When i have my blankie
I feel so wonderful

Verse 1 
When you‚Äôre feeling worried

When you need to feel so safe
Your blankie‚Äôs always there

Chorus 
When i have my blankie
I feel so wonderful
Oh I love my blankie
It‚Äôs the best blankie of all!

Verse 2
When I play with blankie
I make it any shape
I‚Äôm a superhero
And my blankie is my cape!

Chorus 
When i have my blankie
I feel so wonderful
Oh I love my blankie
It‚Äôs the best blankie of all!

Verse 3 
When i feel like flying
And soaring in the air
I pretend I‚Äôm in the sky
And blankie takes me there

Chorus 
When i have my blankie
I feel so wonderful
Oh I love my blankie
It‚Äôs the best blankie of all!

Verse 4 
When it‚Äôs time for sleeping
You know just what to do
When it‚Äôs time to get tucked in
Your blankie snuggles you!

Chorus 
Cody: When i have my blankie
Cody: I feel so wonderful
Everyone: Yes we love your blankie

Lyrics: 
VERSE 1
No time to stop
Pick up the pace
Pedal to the metal
We‚Äôre in a race!

CHORUS
Driving fast, driving hard
We‚Äôre flying! (We are?)
Turning fast, turning hard
We‚Äôre racing!
Zoom-zoom-zoom
Around we go!

VERSE 2
Weaving around
I‚Äôm on my way
Pedal to the metal
We‚Äôre in a race! 

CHORUS
Driving fast, driving hard
We‚Äôre flying!
Turning fast, turning hard
We‚Äôre racing!
Zoom-zoom-zoom
Around we go!!

VERSE 3
Screeching to a stop
The pit stop place
Pedal to the metal
We‚Äôre in a race! 

CHORUS
Driving fast, driving hard
We‚Äôre flying!
Turning fast, turning hard
We‚Äôre racing!
Zoom-zoom-zoom
Around we go!

VERSE 4
Gotta keep on moving
Watch me go
Pedal to the metal
We‚Äôre in a race

CHORUS
Driving fast, driving hard
We‚Äôre flying!
Turning fast, turning hard
We‚Äôre racing!
Zoom-zoom-zoom
Around we go!

VERSE 5
The ending is in sight
Here I come
Pedal to the metal
We‚Äôre in a race!

SAD MUSIC INTERLUDE
Verse 5:
Hey diddle diddle the cat and the fiddle

WALLY: Let‚Äôs rewrite this show!

Lyrics: 
VERSE 1
I‚Äôm on a train!
I‚Äôm listening
To all the sounds
The engine makes!
And ‚Äòneath the train
There are some tracks! 
The train goes Clicka Clacka!
I‚Äôm on a train!

VERSE 2
I‚Äôm on a train!
I‚Äôm listening
To all the sounds
The engine makes!
And on this train
There are some wheels!
The train goes Clicka Clacka! Chugga Chugga
I‚Äôm on a train!

VERSE 3
I‚Äôm on a train!
I‚Äôm listening
To all the sounds
The engine makes!
And on this train
There is a whistle!
The train goes Clicka Clacka! Chugga Chugga, Choo! Choo!
I‚Äôm on a train

VERSE 4
I‚Äôm on a train!
I‚Äôm listening
To all the sounds
The engine makes!
And on this train
There‚Äôs a conductor!
The train goes Clicka Clacka! Chugga Chugga, Choo! Choo!  ‚ÄúAll aboard!‚Äù
I‚Äôm on a train!

VERSE 5
I‚Äôm on a train!
I‚Äôm listening
To all the sounds
The engine makes!
And on this train
We say goodbye!
The train goes Clicka Clacka! Chugga Chugga, Choo Choo! ‚ÄúAll aboard!‚Äù ‚ÄúBye-bye!‚Äù
I‚Äôm on a train!

Swimming Pool SPLASH! Fun Summer Songs - Lellobee by CoComelon,2023-04-27T07:00:00Z,PT2M11S,3388862,3659,N/A,Cocomelon - Nursery Rhymes,UCbCmjCuTUZos6Inko4u57UQ,"üêùSUBSCRIBE for new Lellobee cartoons and songs every week! 
https://www.youtube.com/@LellobeeCityFarm?sub_confirmation=1

Mei fills an inflatable swimming pool with water so Ella and Rishi can have a 'who can make the biggest splash?' competition. They jump, cannonball, dive, bellyflop and swing in. Their splashes get bigger and bigger. But things get ridiculous when Pablo the pig and Heidi the horse join in too!

üêùLellobee City Farm is a new kids cartoon show from the creators of CoComelon.
It is a fun, music-based show for preschoolers, 2-5 years olds. The show is set in the fantastical urban micro-farm, where neighborhood kids gather to play, sing, help each other and learn.

Ella has her first camping experience with Grandma Mei on Lellobee City Farm. They put up their tent, light a fire, roast marshmallows, watch fireflies and drink hot chocolate. They even see a racoon! It‚Äôs time to gather around the campfire for a special sing-a-long.

üêùLellobee City Farm is a new kids cartoon show from the creators of CoComelon.
It is a fun, music-based show for preschoolers, 2-5 years olds. The show is set in the fantastical urban micro-farm, where neighborhood kids gather to play, sing, help each other and learn.

Let‚Äôs go camping
(Camping!) 
And sing our camping song
La la la la la la la

Let‚Äôs put up our tent
Camping is much easier
With your friends
Let‚Äôs go camping
(Camping!)
And sing our camping song

Let‚Äôs all do the camping sing-a-long

A fire will keep us warm tonight
And It will help us see in the evening light
Let‚Äôs go camping
And sing our camping song

Let‚Äôs all do the camping sing-a-long
(Sing-a-long!)
Gather ‚Äòround and sing the camping song
(The camping song!)

It‚Äôs time for a sweet marshmallow roast
As the fireflies twinkle and glow
There‚Äôs so much beauty everywhere
And the smell of hot chocolate is in the air!

Let‚Äôs all do the camping sing-a-long
(Sing-a-long!)

It‚Äôs getting late
We should go to sleep soon
What‚Äôs that noise? 
A friendly raccoon! 
I love camping
Let‚Äôs sing our camping song

Let‚Äôs all do the camping sing-a-long
(Sing-a-long!)
Gather ‚Äòround and sing the camping song

It‚Äôs a stormy day on Lellobee City Farm. Thunder is rumbling and lightning is flashing. Ella is a bit frightened by it all but Grandma Mei shows her that there is nothing to be scared of. They both watch the animals having fun outside and when the storm has passed Ella joins them to jump in puddles!

üêùLyricsüêù
There‚Äôs a thunderstorm
It isn‚Äôt very warm
It‚Äôs really wet outside
Oh my - let‚Äôs sit by the window
And we will hear the sounds
Of raindrops pouring down
But please don‚Äôt be afraid
It‚Äôs okay
On this thunderstormy day

Do you hear that sound - crack crack crack 
That‚Äôs a lightning bolt
And there‚Äôs the big low rumble of the thunder! 

Look at all the clouds
They‚Äôre dark but anyhow
There‚Äôs nothing we should fear
We‚Äôre all here
On this thunderstormy day

Do you hear that sounds - swoosh swoosh swoosh
That‚Äôs the blowing wind
And there‚Äôs the big low rumble of the thunder! 

Storms are cool
Storms are fun
And they leave lots of puddles 
When the storm is done!

The rain has gone away
So let‚Äôs go out and play
Get on your rubber boots
Look at that!
The clouds are clearing up now!
What a special day 
In a stormy way
We weren‚Äôt afraid you see
You and me
On Lellobee!
A stormy day
On Lellobee!

She‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre healthy
In every way

VERSE 2
She‚Äôll check your lungs, she‚Äôll check your heart
She‚Äôll make sure they‚Äôre working, every part

CHORUS
When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
She‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre healthy
In every way

VERSE 3
She‚Äôll check your eyes, she‚Äôll check your ears
She‚Äôll check how well you see and hear

CHORUS
When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
She‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre healthy
In every way

VERSE 4
She‚Äôll check your mouth, she‚Äôll check your throat
She‚Äôll look at her checklist and make some notes

CHORUS 
When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
She‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre healthy
In every way

VERSE 5
She‚Äôll check your reflex, she‚Äôll check your bones
To see that they‚Äôre healthy, and how much you‚Äôve grown

CHORUS
When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
She‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre healthy
In every way

VERSE 6
Now she might say that you need a shot
But don‚Äôt be scared, it won‚Äôt hurt a lot

CHORUS
When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
She‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre healthy
In every way

Lyrics:
The ants go marching one by one, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching one by one, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching one by one,
The little one stops to suck his thumb
and they all go marching down to the ground
To get out of the rain, BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

The ants go marching two by two, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching two by two, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching two by two,
The little one stops to tie his shoe
And they all go marching down to the ground
To get out of the rain, BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

The ants go marching three by three, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching three by three, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching three by three,
The little one stops to climb a tree
And they all go marching down to the ground
To get out of the rain, BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
 
The ants go marching four by four, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching four by four, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching four by four,
The little one stops to shut the door
And they all go marching down to the ground
To get out of the rain, BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

The ants go marching five by five, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching five by five, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching five by five,
The little one stops to check the skies
And they all go marching down to the ground
To get out of the rain, BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

The ants go marching six by six, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching six by six, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching six by six,
The little one stops to pick up sticks
And they all go marching down to the ground
To get out of the rain, BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

The ants go marching seven by seven, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching seven by seven, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching seven by seven,
The little one stops to eat a lemon
And they all go marching down to the ground
To get out of the rain, BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

The ants go marching eight by eight, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching eight by eight, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching eight by eight,
The little one stops he‚Äôs feeling great
And they all go marching down to the ground
To get out of the rain, BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

The ants go marching nine by nine, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching nine by nine, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching nine by nine,
The little one stops to check the time(Sun clock)
And they all go marching down to the ground
To get out of the rain, BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

The ants go marching ten by ten, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching ten by ten, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching ten by ten,
The little one stops to say ""THE END""

The truck is coming down the lane
BEEP BEEP
Let‚Äôs all start
And do our part 
We forgot the recycling!!
The Earth needs our help today!

Verse 1: Everyone
Today‚Äôs recycling day
Having lots of fun
Today‚Äôs recycling day
Let‚Äôs sort them out -- okay!

TomTom: (chant) Paper! 
YoYo: (chant) Plastic! 
JJ: (chant) Cans!  
I love recycling day!

Chorus:
Today is recycling day  
The truck is coming down the lane
BEEP BEEP
Let‚Äôs all start
And do our part 
The Earth needs our help today!

Verse 2: Everyone
Today is recycling day 
Having lots of fun
Let‚Äôs put them in their place ‚Äì okay!

TomTom: (chant) Paper! 
YoYo: (chant) Plastic! 
JJ: (chant) Cans!  
I love recycling day!

Verse 3: Everyone
Today is recycling day 
Having lots of fun
Today is recycling day 
Wheeling the bins away- Okay

JJ, TomTom & YoYo :  (chant) Paper! Plastic! Cans!
I love recycling day!

Chorus:
Today is recycling day 
The truck is coming down the lane
BEEP BEEP
Let‚Äôs all start
And do our part 
The Earth needs our help today!

We love Halloween,
It's our favorite night! 
Silly, kooky, fun surprises, 
give us such a fright!

I love Halloween, 
it's my favorite night
Making all the decorations 
Making them just right 

We love Halloween,
It's our favorite night! 
Getting goofy and so crafty
It‚Äôs a silly sight!

I love Halloween, 
It's my favorite night
Filling bags for trick or treaters
Fill them up just right

We love Halloween 
It's our favorite night
With surprises for our friends
They‚Äôll love every bite

I love Halloween, 
it's my favorite night
Carve a Jack-o-lantern face
Carve it out just right 

We love Halloween,
It‚Äôs our favorite night! 
Goofy ghosts and mummies
Smiling in the light

We love Halloween,
It's our favorite night! 
Silly, kookie, fun surprises, 
give us such a fright!

Lyrics:
Heroes to the rescue,
With my firefighter crew.
When there's danger,
We roll out!

Heroes to the rescue,
In our bright red hats, too.
Brave and daring.  
Here we come!

Heroes to the rescue,
Wearing sturdy strong boots.
Stomp on forward. 
Lets suit up! 

Heroes to the rescue,
Our firetruck goes ""woo"".  
‚ÄúWee-Ooh‚Äù, ‚ÄúWee-Ooh‚Äù. 
On our way!

Heroes to the rescue
Our fire hose goes ""woosh""         
‚ÄúWoo-woosh‚Äù, ‚ÄúWoo-woosh‚Äù 
Put it out!

Heroes to the rescue
It‚Äôs up to me, it‚Äôs up to you         
So heroic 
Save the day!

Heroes to the rescue
With my firefighter crew
When there's danger
We roll out!

Heroes to the rescue
With my firefighter crew
When there's danger
Save the day!

Lyrics:
We‚Äôll go out to the beach today.
We‚Äôre going to laugh and play.
On the sandy beach, under the sun, 
We‚Äôll have so much fun!

Volley the ball and bump, bump, bump
Bump, bump as high as you can
Volley the ball and bump, bump, bump
Bump, bump as high as you can

We‚Äôll go out to the beach today.
We‚Äôre going to laugh and play.
On the sandy beach, under the sun, 
We‚Äôll have so much fun!

Let‚Äôs toss the ball and swing, swing, swing
Swing, swing as hard as you can
Let‚Äôs toss the ball and swing, swing, swing
Swing, swing as hard as you can

We‚Äôll go out to the beach today.
We‚Äôre going to laugh and play.
On the sandy beach, under the sun, 
We‚Äôll have so much fun!
 
Ready, set, go! And kick, kick, kick
Kick, kick as strong as you can
Ready, set, go! And kick, kick, kick
Kick, kick as strong as you can

We‚Äôll go out to the beach today
We‚Äôre going to laugh and play
On the sandy beach, under the sun 
We‚Äôll have so much fun!

Get on the board and paddle, paddle, paddle 
Paddle as best as you can
Get on the board and paddle, paddle paddle
Paddle as best as you can

We went out to the beach today.
We went out to laugh and play.
On the sandy beach, under the sun, 
We had so much fun!

Lyrics:
No time to stop
Pick up the pace
Pedal to the metal  
We‚Äôre in a race!     

Driving fast, driving hard
We‚Äôre flying!      (We are?) 
Turning fast, turning hard
We‚Äôre racing!
Zoom-zoom-zoom
Around we go!

Weaving around
I‚Äôm on my way
Pedal to the metal 
We‚Äôre in a race

Driving fast, driving hard
We‚Äôre flying!
Turning fast, turning hard
We‚Äôre racing!
Zoom-zoom-zoom
Around we go!!

Screeching to a stop
The pit stop place
Pedal to the metal 
We‚Äôre in a race!

Driving fast, driving hard
We‚Äôre flying!
Turning fast, turning hard
We‚Äôre racing!
Zoom-zoom-zoom
Around we go!

Gotta keep on moving
Watch me go
Pedal to the metal
We‚Äôre in a race

Driving fast, driving hard
We‚Äôre flying!
Turning fast, turning hard
We‚Äôre racing!
Zoom-zoom-zoom
Around we go!

The ending is in sight
Here I come
Pedal to the medal
We‚Äôre in a race!

Lyrics:
Baa, baa, black sheep,
have you any wool?
Yes sir, yes sir, 
three bags full!

One for the farmer,
One for the dame,
And one for the little boy
Who lives down the lane

Baa, baa, black sheep,
Have you any wool?
Yes sir, yes sir, 
three bags full!

Baa, Baa, blue sheep,
have you any wool?
Yes sir, yes sir, 
three bags full!

One for the farmer,
One for the dame,
And one for the little boy
Who lives down the lane

Baa, baa, blue sheep,
have you any wool?
Yes sir, yes sir, 
three bags full!

Baa, baa, pink sheep,
have you any wool?
Yes sir, yes sir, 
three bags full!

One for the farmer,
One for the dame,
And one for the little boy
Who lives down the lane

Baa, baa, pink sheep,
have you any wool?
Yes sir, yes sir, 
three bags full!

Baa, baa, white sheep,
have you any wool?
Yes sir, yes sir, 
three bags full!

One for the farmer,
One for the dame,
And one for the little boy
Who lives down the lane

Baa, baa, white sheep,
have you any wool?
Yes sir, yes sir, 
three bags full!

Lyrics:
Happy birthday
It‚Äôs your special day
You were born on this date
Now it‚Äôs time to celebrate 
Happy birthday
It‚Äôs your special day
‚ÄòCause you turn one year older today
 
Happy birthday
It‚Äôs your special day
Your family is here
And your friends are spreading cheer
Happy birthday
It‚Äôs your special day
‚ÄòCause you turn one year older today
 
Happy birthday
It‚Äôs your special day
There are presents wrapped in bows
Is it toys? Is it clothes? 
Happy birthday
It‚Äôs your special day
‚ÄòCause you turn one year older
Yeah one year older
One year older today‚Äîhooray!

Happy birthday
It‚Äôs your special day
You were born on this date
Now it‚Äôs time to celebrate 
Happy birthday
It‚Äôs your special day
‚ÄòCause you turn one year older
Yes, one year older
One year older today‚Äîhooray!

It‚Äôs my birthday
It‚Äôs my special day
With the candles lit up bright
Blow them out with all my might
It‚Äôs my birthday
It‚Äôs my special day
‚ÄòCause I turn one year older today
One year older today - hooray!

Lyrics:
I‚Äôm looking for my birthday 
Right there, right here
I‚Äôm looking for my birthday 
But it‚Äôs not here
I hope I get a big surprise
Can‚Äôt wait to see it with my own eyes
And We‚Äôll celebrate with treats
And balloons
Party all
afternoon!
 
Searching, searching, searching, searching‚Ä¶
 
I‚Äôm looking for my birthday 
Up there, up here
I‚Äôm looking for my birthday 
But it‚Äôs not here
I hope I get a big surprise
Can‚Äôt wait to see it with my own eyes
And I‚Äôll blow my candles out
Like this
Close my eyes
Make a wish
 
Searching, searching, searching, searching‚Ä¶
 
I‚Äôm looking for my birthday 
Down there, down here
I‚Äôm looking for my birthday 
But it‚Äôs not here
I hope I get a big surprise
Can‚Äôt wait to see it with my own eyes
And I‚Äôll party with my friends
And we‚Äôll dance
Wearing my
Party pants
 
Searching, searching, searching, searching‚Ä¶
 
I‚Äôm looking for my birthday 
Out there, out here
I‚Äôm looking for my birthday 
But it‚Äôs not here
 
Mom, Dad, TomTom, Yoyo: Surprise!
 
I hope I get a big surprise
Can‚Äôt wait to see it with my own eyes
And I‚Äôll give out lots of hugs
And I‚Äôll say
 
For today
 
Thank you, thank you, thank you...
 
I‚Äôm looking for my birthday 
In there, in here
I‚Äôm looking for my birthday 
But it‚Äôs not here
I hope I get a big surprise
Can‚Äôt wait to see it with my own eyes
And I‚Äôll celebrate with my family
It‚Äôs a day

Just go before you go

We are all ready to go!

Ready ready ready‚Ä¶
Wait, I‚Äôve got to go!

Don‚Äôt wait till it‚Äôs too late. Or you‚Äôll have to wait to go!

Go before you go!
Go before you go!
Don‚Äôt wait till it‚Äôs too late.
Just go before you go

We are all ready to go!
On a walk with Bingo!
Ready ready ready!
Wait... I‚Äôve got to go!

Don‚Äôt wait till it‚Äôs too late. Or you‚Äôll have to wait to go!

Go before you go!
Go before you go!
Don‚Äôt wait till it‚Äôs too late.
Just go before you go

We‚Äôre finally ready to go!
On a walk with Bingo
Ready ready ready!
Wait. Now I‚Äôve got to go!

Don‚Äôt wait till it‚Äôs too late. Or you‚Äôll have to wait to go!

Go before you go!
Go before you go!
Don‚Äôt wait till it‚Äôs too late.

Lyrics:
Twinkle twinkle little star.
How I wonder what you are.
Up above the world so high.
Like a diamond in the sky.
Twinkle twinkle little star.
How I wonder what you are.
Verse 2
Twinkle twinkle little star.
How I wonder what you are.
Up above the world so high.
Like a diamond in the sky.
Twinkle twinkle little star.
How I wonder what you are.
Verse 3
Twinkle twinkle little star.
How I wonder what you are.
Up above the world so high.
Like a diamond in the sky.
Twinkle twinkle little star.
How I wonder what you are.
Verse 4
Twinkle twinkle little star.
How I wonder what you are.
Up above the world so high.
Like a diamond in the sky.
Twinkle twinkle little star.
How I wonder what you are.

The wipers on the bus go swish swish swish. Swish swish swish. 
Swish swish swish. 
The wipers on the bus go swish swish swish. All through the town! 

The horn on the bus goes beep beep beep. Beep beep beep.

The horn on the bus goes beep beep beep. All through the town! 

The Mommy on the bus goes shh shh shh. Shh shh shh.

The Mommy on the bus goes shh shh shh. All through the town! 

The signals on the bus goes blink blink blink. Blink blink blink. 
Blink blink blink. 
The signals on the bus goes blink blink blink. All through the town! 

The motor on the bus goes vroom vroom vroom.
Vroom vroom vroom. 
Vroom vroom vroom.

The wheels on the bus go ‚Äòround and ‚Äòround. ‚ÄòRound and ‚Äòround.

Lyrics:
Our pets love us every day
They bring us joy in many ways
We feed them, play and pet them too      
It‚Äôs how we tell them I love you!
 
When pets say woof woof! Miaow miaow! SQUEAK!
Do they need to play, be pet, or eat?  
We could give them food to munch 
Yum yum yum, crunch crunch crunch! 

We love their‚Ä¶.
Waggly tails and fluffy fur
Doggy woofs and kitten purrs
Hamster squeaks and little feet
Caring for them is so neat! 

When pets say woof woof! Miaow miaow! SQUEAK!  
Do they need to play, be pet or eat?
We could let them play outside!                   
Run run run, and exercise!                                        

We love their‚Ä¶.
Waggly tails and fluffy fur
Doggy woofs and kitten purrs
Hamster squeaks and little feet
Caring for them is so neat!

When pets say woof woof! Miaow miaow! SQUEAK!
Do they need to play, be pet, or eat?  
We could gently pet their fur
Pet pet pet, purr purr purr!

We love their‚Ä¶.
Waggly tails and fluffy fur
Doggy woofs and kitten purrs
Hamster squeaks and little feet
Caring for them is so neat!

When pets say woof woof! Miaow miaow! SQUEAK!
Do they need to play, be pet, or eat?  
They need our love in every way             
Love love love them every day!

We love their‚Ä¶.
Waggly tails and fluffy fur
Doggy woofs and kitten purrs
Hamster squeaks and little feet
Caring for them is so neat!

Our pets love us every day
They bring us joy in many ways
We feed them, play and pet them too      
It‚Äôs how we tell them I love you!

Lyrics:
I‚Äôm going to the dentist
I‚Äôm going to the dentist
What will happen there?  

What will I see?
What will I do?
Can you tell me what will happen there?    
  
You‚Äôre going to the dentist
You‚Äôre going to the dentist 
What will happen there?
We‚Äôll tell you!
Your chair goes down and up!
It even fills up your cup!
Have you ever seen such a funny chair!            
                                              
You‚Äôre going to the dentist
You‚Äôre going to the dentist
What will happen there?
We‚Äôll tell you!
The mirror‚Äôs fun and shiny
It‚Äôs teeny and teeny tiny!
They‚Äôll check your gums are healthy everywhere!   
                   
You‚Äôre going to the dentist
You‚Äôre going to the dentist
What will happen there?
We‚Äôll tell you!
The toothbrush cleans your teeth                                          
Around and in between                                                        
It‚Äôs buzzy and it‚Äôs tickly here and there!                                                                                                                                         

You‚Äôre going to the dentist
You‚Äôre going to the dentist
What will happen there?
We‚Äôll tell you!
The goody bag is so fun
You‚Äôll get one when you‚Äôre done!
There are goodies and surprises you can share 
                                                          
I‚Äôm going to the dentist
I‚Äôm going to the dentist
What will happen there?

Now I know
It will be great!
Now I know what will happen there!

Lyrics:
Miss Polly had a dolly who was sick, sick, sick.
So she called for the doc-tor to be quick, quick, quick.
The doctor ca-me with his bag and his hat.
And he kno-cked on the do-or with a rat-a-tat-tat.

He looked at the dolly and he shook his head.
He said ""Miss Pol-ly, put him straight to bed"".
If you want to make him feel his best, best, best.
This dolly needs to go- get some rest, rest, rest.

Miss Polly had a dolly who was sick, sick, sick.
So she called for the doctor to be quick, quick, quick.
The doc-tor ca-me with his bag and his hat.
And he knoc-ked on the door with a rat-a-tat-tat.

He looked at the dolly and he shook his head
He said ""Miss Pol-ly, put him straight to bed""
If you want to make him feel his best, best, best
This dolly needs to go- get some rest, rest, rest.

Miss Polly had a dolly who was sick, sick, sick.
So she called for the doctor to be quick, quick, quick.
The doctor came with his bag and his hat.
And he knocked on the door with a rat-a-tat-tat.

He looked at the dolly and he shook his head.
He said ""Miss Polly, put him straight to bed"".
The dolly went to bed, and he slept all night,
And wo-ke in the morning, feeling quite alright!

Time to Brush It

If you want your teeth strong and fit, you need to brush for TWO WHOLE MINUTES!
 
Toothbrush check! 
Get our brush wet!

Squeeze some out 
It‚Äôs time to workout!
For TWO MINUTES!
Brush ‚Äòem, Brush ‚Äòem   
C‚Äômon brush along!

Up top, Up top
Brush it! Brush it!
Don‚Äôt stop, Don‚Äôt stop.
Up top, Up top
Brush it Brush it 
Don‚Äôt stop, Don‚Äôt stop
Brush it, Brush it good 
OOOOH! Brush it.

Switch it up! Other side! Now - let‚Äôs go!

Up top, Up top
Round and Around
Don‚Äôt stop, Don‚Äôt stop.
Up top, Up top
Round and around
Don‚Äôt stop, Don‚Äôt stop

OOOOH! Brush it!

Lyrics:
Old MacDonald had a farm.    
EE-I-EE-I-O.
And on his farm was a baby goat.  
EE-I-EE-I-O. 

A baby goat is called a kid.

With a meh-meh here, and a meh-meh there. 
Here a meh. There a meh.
Everywhere a meh-meh.
Old MacDonald had a farm.    
EE-I-EE-I-O.

Old MacDonald had a farm.    
EE-I-EE-I-O.
And on his farm was a baby cow.  
EE-I-EE-I-O.

A baby cow is called a calf.

With a moo-moo here, and a moo-moo there.
Here a moo. There a moo.
Everywhere a moo-moo.
Old MacDonald had a farm.    
EE-I-EE-I-O.

Old MacDonald had a farm.    
EE-I-EE-I-O.
And on his farm was a baby sheep.  
EE-I-EE-I-O.

A baby sheep is called a lamb.

With a baa-baa here and a baa-baa there.
Here a baa. There a baa.
Everywhere a baa-baa.
Old MacDonald had a farm.    
EE-I-EE-I-O.

Old MacDonald had a farm.    
EE-I-EE-I-O.
And on his farm were  baby chickens.  
EE-I-EE-I-O.

Baby chickens are called chicks.

With a peep-peep here and a peep-peep there.
Here a peep. There a peep.
Everywhere a peep-peep.
Old MacDonald had a farm.    
EE-I-EE-I-O.

Old MacDonald had a farm.    
EE-I-EE-I-O.
And on his farm was a baby lion! 
EE-I-EE-I-O.
JJ (Giggling): A baby lion is called a cub.
With a roar-roar here and a roar-roar there.
Here a roar. There a roar.
Everywhere a roar-roar.
Old MacDonald had a farm.    
EE-I-EE-I-O.

Old MacDonald had a farm.    
EE-I-EE-I-O.
And on his farm were baby animals.
EE-I-EE-I-O.
With a meh-meh here and a moo-moo there.
Here a baa. There a peep.
Everywhere a roar-roar.
Old MacDonald had a farm.
EE-I-EE-I-O!

Lyrics
Roses are red.
Violets are blue.
My valentine says
Crazy ‚Äòbout you!

Roses are red.
Petunia‚Äôs are pink.
My valentine says
My honey bee!

On Valentine‚Äôs day we show we care.
We all have fun, we laugh and share.
On Valentine‚Äôs Day here‚Äôs what we do.
We tell our friends ‚ÄúI love you!‚Äù

Roses are red.
Clovers are green.
My valentine says
You‚Äôre so sweet!

Roses are red.
Daisey‚Äôs are white.
My valentine says
Hu-g me tight!

On Valentine‚Äôs day we show we care.
We all have fun, we laugh and share.
On Valentine‚Äôs Day here‚Äôs what we do.

We tell our friends ‚ÄúI love you!‚Äù

Roses are red.
Tulips are peach.
My valentine says.
You‚Äôre such a cutie!

Roses are red.
Lilies are pearl.
My valentine says.
You rock my world!

On Valentine‚Äôs Day here‚Äôs what we do.
We tell our friends ‚ÄúI love you!‚Äù

Lyrics:
These are African instruments
We play them in different ways
Let‚Äôs all make some MUSIC!
C‚Äômon, it‚Äôs time to play!

This is the balafon 
Africa is where it‚Äôs found
Made of bamboo and wood
It makes a sound

This is the Fula flute 
Move your fingers up and down
When you play this special flute 
It makes a sound!

These are African instruments
We play them in different ways
Let‚Äôs all make some MUSIC!
C‚Äômon, it‚Äôs time to play!

This is the sangba drum
You lay it on the ground
When you hit the side and bell
It makes a sound

These are African instruments
We play them in different ways
Let‚Äôs all make some MUSIC!
C‚Äômon, it‚Äôs time to play!

Lyrics:
Jolly old Saint Nicholas
Lean your ear this way;
Don't you tell a single soul
What I'm going to say,
Christmas Eve is coming soon;
Now you dear old man,
Whisper what you'll bring to me;
Tell me if you can.

Ho Ho Ho!

When the clock is striking twelve,
When I'm fast asleep,
Down the chimney broad and black
With your pack you'll creep;
All the stockings you will find
Hanging in a row;
Mine will be the shortest one;
You'll be sure to know.

Ho Ho Ho!

Mom and dad want grown up things
YoYo wants a dolly
TomTom wants a story book,
Christmas sure is jolly
As for me, it‚Äôs getting late
This ole Christmas night
Choose for me, dear Santa Claus,
What you think is right.

Jolly old Saint Nicholas
Lean your ear this way;
Don't you tell a single soul
What I'm going to say,
Christmas Day is here at last
And it‚Äôs time to see
What you brought to me last night
Underneath our tree

Ho Ho Ho!

Lyrics:
Verse 1
Deck the halls with boughs of holly.
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la!
'Tis the season to be jolly.
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la!
Don we now our gay apparel.
Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la!
Troll the ancient Yule-tide carol.
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la!

Verse 2
See the blazing Yule before us.
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la!
Strike the harp and join the chorus.
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la!
Follow me in merry measure.
Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la!
While I tell of Yule-tide treasure.
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la!

Verse 3
Fast away the old year passes.
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la!
Hail the new year, lads and lasses.
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la!
Sing we joyous, all together.
Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la!
Heedless of the wind and weather.
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la!

Verse 4
Deck the halls with boughs of holly.
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la!
'Tis the season to be jolly.
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la!
Don we now our gay apparel.
Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la!
Troll the ancient Yule-tide carol.
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la!

I can't sleep I had a bad dream
I need mommy here with me
Daddy please! Stay by my side
I can't sleep, Although I tried
 
When you wake from a bad dream
Look around, what can you see?
Cozy in your happy place
Snug in bed so warm and safe

Lots of things can help you sleep
Look around, what can you see?
Hold your cuddle buddy tight
Cuddles help you sleep tonight

Lots of things can help you sleep
Look around, what can you see?
Watch the night light glowing bright
Light will help you sleep tonight
 
Spoken (Cody): Mommy? Daddy?

When you wake from a bad dream
Look around, what can you see?
Cozy in your happy place
Snug in bed so warm and safe

Lots of things can help you sleep
Look around, what can you see?
Mommy gives a hug so tight
Hugs will help you sleep tonight

When you wake from a bad dream
Look around, what can you see?
Cozy in your happy place
Snug in bed so warm and safe

We will go outside and run around
We‚Äôll have so much fun 

Verse 4
Take the kite and fly, fly, fly,                                   
Fly, fly as high as you can
Take the kite and fly, fly, fly, 
Fly, fly as high as you can

Chorus 5
We went out to the park today
We went out to run and play
We ALL went outside to run around
We had so much fun

Down by the station
Early in the morning
See the little train cars
All in a row
See the station master
Turn the little handle
Chug chug toot toot  
Off they go

Down by the station
Early in the morning
See the shiny train cars
All in a row
Waiting to get hitched up
And go on their adventure
Chug chug toot toot 
Off they go

Down by the station
Early in the morning
See my favorite engine
Ready to tow
All the other train cars
Will follow on behind it
Chug chug toot toot 
Off they go

Down by the station
Early in the morning
Climb on aboard
And hear the whistle blow
Mr. Conductor
Please take my ticket
Chug chug toot toot 
Off they go

Down by the station
Early in the morning
See the little train cars
All in a row
See the station master
Turn the little handle
Chug chug puff puff
Off they go

See the station master
Turn the little handle
Chug chug toot toot 
Off they go
Chug chug toot toot
Off they go

Lyrics:
Back to school, back to school
Back to school today!
What will I learn? What will I play?                
Back to school today!

Pack my books with a zip zap zip
I love to go to school
Pack my pencils with a clip clap clip   
I love to go to school

Pack my lunch in the box box box
I love to go to school
Find clean pants and socks socks socks
I love to go to school 

Back to school, back to school
Back to school today!
What will I learn? What will I play?
Back to school today!

Grab my bag, no time to snooze!
I love to go to school
Sharing news in my new shoes
I love to go to school!

I can paint and make some crafts
I love to go to school
Sing and dance with lots of laughs
I love to go to school

Back to school, back to school
Back to school today!
What will I learn? What will I play?
Back to school today!

I can sing my ABCs 
I love to go to school       
I can count to 123!
I love to go to school   

We can play with all our friends               
We love to go to school
(It) feels like fun will never end!
We love to go to school

Back to school, back to school
Back to school today!
What will we learn? What will we play?
Back to school today

Lyrics:
Chorus: JJ
I want you to know
You‚Äôre not alone
I wave wave wave
And now I‚Äôve shown:
If you need me
I can be there!* 
One kind act
Can show I care!

Verse 1: Cody  
You noticed I seemed sad
I‚Äôm better thanks to you
Now that I don‚Äôt feel so sad
Interlude: 4 seconds
I can help somebody too!

Chorus: Cody
I want you to know
You‚Äôre not alone
I wave wave wave
And now I‚Äôve shown:
If you need me
I can be there!
One kind act
Can show I care!

Verse 2: Bella
You noticed I seemed shy
I‚Äôm better thanks to you 
Now that I don‚Äôt feel so shy
I can help somebody too!


Chorus: Bella
I want you to know
You‚Äôre not alone
I wave wave wave
And now I‚Äôve shown:
If you need me
I can be there!
One kind act
Can show I care!

Verse 3: Cece
You noticed I seemed mad
I‚Äôm better thanks to you
Now that I don‚Äôt feel so mad
I can help somebody too!


Chorus
We want you to know
You‚Äôre not alone
We wave wave wave
And now we‚Äôve shown:
If you need us
We can be there!
A few little waves
Can show we care!

Lyrics:
This box will get recycled soon
But while it‚Äôs still here with me
I‚Äôll close my eyes and think about
All the fun things it could be‚Ä¶

Sometimes I play with a toy
Sometimes I play with a friend
But when I play with this box,* 
I get to play pretend!

This box is a tough turtle shell
Resting on top of my back!
I hide my turtle head inside‚Ä¶
Then poke it out for a snack!

This box will get recycled soon
But while it‚Äôs still here with me
I‚Äôll close my eyes and think about
All the fun things it could be‚Ä¶

This box is a big bongo drum!
I bang it to play a song
I go TAP TAP, I go BOOM BOOM
I stomp and I sing along

This box rocks!

This box will get recycled soon
But while it‚Äôs still here with me
I‚Äôll close my eyes and think about
All the fun things it could be‚Ä¶

This box is a speedy race car!
ZOOMing and VROOMing around
Pickles is the race car driver
And I‚Äôm in charge of the sounds:

ZOOM! VROOM! BEEP! BEEP!

Pickles SFX: MEOW

SCREECH!
...There‚Äôs a ladybug crossing the street!

This box will get recycled soon
But while it‚Äôs still here with me
I‚Äôll close my eyes and think about
All the fun things it could be‚Ä¶

These boxes will get recycled soon
But while they‚Äôre still here with me
We‚Äôll close our eyes and think about
All the fun things they could be‚Ä¶
All the fun things these boxes could be!

Hush little JJ, it‚Äôs time for bed
Go to sleep and rest your head

La la da dum

And if you can‚Äôt go to sleep
Papa‚Äôs gonna help you count some sheep

La la la la

You search for gifts all around
Mom says go sleep safe and sound

La la da dum

If you tiptoe down the stairs
Papa‚Äôs gonna carry you back up there

La la la la
Dad: Shhhhhhh 
JJ: Shhhhhhh 

Balloons wait for you to sleep
Papa says, not another peep

La la da dum

Your birthday is a special treat
Mama says, get some rest my sweet

La la la la

Though you still keep sneaking down
You‚Äôre still the sweetest little babe in town‚Ä¶
Tag: Still the sweetest little babe in town

La, la, la. La. la . la‚Ä¶

Lyrics
Let‚Äôs learn a special way 
To stretch and calm ourselves today
Spoken: This is called yoga!
Spoken (Children): Yoga
 
Breeeeeeathe in, breeeeeeathe out
Stretch your body, move about
Breeeeeeathe in, breeeeeeathe out
It feels so good to stretch it out!
 
When you stretch, pretend to be
Like a cat! Follow me!
Arch your back to the sky
Hold that shape, stretch up high.
Spoken: Meow!
 
Breeeeeeathe in, breeeeeeathe out
It feels so good to stretch it out!
 
When you stretch, pretend to be
Like a tree! Follow me!
Stretch your arms to the sky
Hold that shape, stretch up high
Spoken JJ: Whooosh 
 
Breeeeeeathe in, breeeeeeathe out
It feels so good to stretch it out!
 
As you stretch, pretend to be
Like a dog! Follow me!
Lift your doggy nose to the sky
Hold that shape, stretch up high
Spoken JJ: Woof woof!
 
When it‚Äôs hard to keep our cool
Stretching is a useful tool
 
As you stretch, pretend to be
Like a giraffe! Follow me!
Lift your shoulders to the sky
Hold that shape, stretch up high
Spoken: Stretch!
 
Learning the Easy Pose/Butterfly Pose
Breeeeeeathe in, breeeeeeathe out
Stretch your body move about
Breeeeeeathe in, breeeeeeathe out
It feels so good to stretch it out!
 
Spoken Miss Appleberry: It‚Äôs called yoga! 
Spoken Children: Yoga!

Lyrics:
If you‚Äôre happy and you know it, 
clap your hands. 
If you‚Äôre happy and you know it, 
clap your hands. 
If you‚Äôre happy and you know it, 
and you really want to show it. 
If you‚Äôre happy and you know it, 
clap your hands. 

If you‚Äôre hungry and you know it, 
pat your belly. 
If you‚Äôre hungry and you know it, 
pat your belly. 
If you‚Äôre hungry and you know it, 
and you really want to show it.
If you‚Äôre hungry and you know it, 
pat your belly. 

If you‚Äôre tired and you know it, 
stretch and yawn. 
If you‚Äôre tired and you know it, 
stretch and yawn. 
If you‚Äôre tired and you know it, 
and you really want to show it. 
If you‚Äôre tired and you know it, 
stretch and yawn. 

If you‚Äôre angry and you know it, 
take a breath. 
If you‚Äôre angry and you know it, 
take a breath. 
If you‚Äôre angry and you know it, 
and you really want to show it. 
If you‚Äôre angry and you know it, 
take a breath. 

If you‚Äôre surprised and you know it, 
jump right up. 
If you‚Äôre surprised and you know it, 
jump right up. 
If you‚Äôre surprised and you know it, 
and you really want to show it. 
If you‚Äôre surprised and you know it, 
jump right up. 

If you‚Äôre sad and you know it, 
rub your eyes. 
If you‚Äôre sad and you know it, 
rub your eyes. 
If you‚Äôre sad and you know it, 
and you really want to show it. 
If you‚Äôre sad and you know it,  
rub your eyes. 

If you‚Äôre silly and you know it, 
show it off! 
If you‚Äôre silly and you know it, 
show it off. 
If you‚Äôre silly and you know it, 
and you really want to show it. 
If you‚Äôre silly and you know it, 
show it off. 

If you‚Äôre happy and you know it, 
shout hooray. 

Hooray! 

If you‚Äôre happy and you know it, 
shout hooray. 

Hooray!  

If you‚Äôre happy and you know it, 
and you really want to show it. 
If you‚Äôre happy and you know it,

Lyrics:
Going on a doggy hunt.
Going to catch my best friend.
He‚Äôs gonna love it.
Look, what‚Äôs up ahead?

Mud!

Can‚Äôt go over it
Can‚Äôt go under it
Can‚Äôt go through it
I gotta go around it!
Sloshy slosh, sloshy slosh.

Going on a doggy hunt.
Going to catch my best friend.
He‚Äôs gonna love it.
Look, what‚Äôs up ahead?

Party Goodies!

Can‚Äôt go over it
Can‚Äôt go through it
Can‚Äôt go around it
I gotta go under it!
Swish swash, swish swash

Going on a doggy hunt.
Going to catch my best friend.
He‚Äôs gonna love it.
Look, what‚Äôs up ahead?

Wind!

Can‚Äôt go over it
Can‚Äôt go under it
Can‚Äôt go around it
I gotta go through it!
Whoosh woo whoosh woo!

Going on a doggy hunt.
Going to catch my best friend.
He‚Äôs gonna love it.
Look, what‚Äôs up ahead?


Oh look! On the couch! 
What‚Äôs this?

Something funny.
With a long soft thing on its end
With two big ears
And a cold wet nose

Slightly longer interlude
It‚Äôs Bingo!.

Slurpy slurp, slurpy slurp.

C‚Äômon Bingo! I have a surprise for you!

Run through the wind! 
Go under Dad! 
Slosh around the mud! 
And give your best dog a‚Ä¶ a... 

Huh?...

Happy Birthday
Happy Birthday
Happy Birthday
To our good dog!

My Sea Star loves the ocean
With daddy it‚Äôs always so fun
Together we play by the seaside
Under a big yellow sun

Building, Building
Let‚Äôs build a mermaid for you

Oh no!

Look at the beautiful ocean 
Remember we had so much fun
With sand and the seaweed and seashells  
Your mermaid is almost done!

Yoyo: For me!

Turned into a mermaid for me!

I love when it‚Äôs me and my daddy/Sea Star

Sing along to CoComelon's new edition to Itsy Bitsy Spider with the Itsy Bitsy Birdie edition!

Lyrics:
The itsy bitsy birdie was looking at the ground        
Whoosh! Went the wind and the tiny bird fell down    
Out came the family  
To help their birdie friend 
How will itsy bitsy birdie
Get back home again?

The itsy bitsy birdie was scared as could be
Cheep Cheep! She called out for her family
Out came the kids
To help their birdie friend 
How will itsy bitsy birdie
Get back home again?
    
The itsy bitsy birdie was wrapped up safe and sound
Cheep! Called her mama seeing she‚Äôd been found
Out came the ladder
To help their birdie friend 
How will  itsy bitsy birdie
Get back home again?

The itsy bitsy birdie looked up at the tree
Up Up! Went daddy, brave as can be
Out came Mama bird
To see her baby‚Äôs friend
Oh the itsy bitsy birdie‚Äôs
Nearly home again!      

The itsy bitsy birdie was safely tucked away
Hooray! Cried the family, and helped her on her way
Out came the rope
To help their birdie friend
Oh the itsy bitsy birdie
Was safe at home again!

The big brave daddy turned to leave
Clatter! Went the ladder, where his feet should be 
Out came a, YIKES
Can you guess what happened then?

The big, brave daddy
Was safe at home again!

First comes red
It‚Äôs first to show
In a shiny rainbow
Red!

Orange next

Green is gleaming

Purple‚Äôs last
The last to glow

Little bunny foo foo hopping through the forest
With a bunch of field mice
That STOP when the bunny stops

Oh little bunny foo foo, i want to be you
I am little bunny foo foo, you do what i do 
To do what I do 
skip skip skip
try not to trip trip trip

Little bunny foo foo hopping through the forest
With a bunch of field mice
That STOP when the bunny stops

Oh little bunny foo foo, i want to be you
I am little bunny foo foo, you do what i do 
To do what I do 
wiggle wiggle wiggle 
Dont giggle giggle giggle

Little bunny foo foo hopping through the forest
With a bunch of field mice
That STOP when the bunny stops

The fairy came, down down down
To the ground ground ground
To say play play play
The bunny foo foo way!

Little bunny foo foo I don't need to be you

Look dad, I can help you too!
Oh wait! I'm not as big as you

I love working with my son
Clean and clean till the job is done
Look son, you can help me too!

Think about the joy it brings
Let it go and you will see

It was so fun to strum strum strum!

Lyrics:
How can I show you
The million ways I care?
Oh how can I share 
The way I love, love, love, love you?

Sometimes we say it, 
with glitter paint and glue
Sometimes we say it
With words and what we do
There‚Äôs a lot of ways to show you. 
The million ways - I love you!

La-la-la, 
La-la-la, 
La-la, 
La-la, la-la-la,

How can I show you
The million ways I care?
Oh how can I share 
The way I love, love, love, love you?

Sometimes we say it, 
With things we made ourselves

Sometimes we say it
With a smile, kiss or cuddles!
There‚Äôs a lot of ways to show you. 
The million ways - I love you!

La, la, 
La-la, la, 
La-la, la-la, 
La-la,

How can I show you 
The million ways I care?
Oh how can I share 
The way I love, love, love, love you?

Sometimes we say it, 
When we listen and are kind
Sometimes we say it
With chores, and spending time!
There‚Äôs a lot of ways to show you. 
The million ways - I love you!

La-la-la, 
La-la-la, 
La-la, 
La, la, la,

How can I show you
The million ways I care?
Oh how can I share 
The way I love, love, love, love you?


Sometimes we say it, 
With patience and friendship 
Sometimes we say it
With dancing and music
There‚Äôs a lot of ways to show you. 
The million ways - I love you!

All round the farm with Christmas cheer

Neigh neigh neigh - says the horse
Neigh neigh neigh - says the horse

Good old grandpa is our guide
All round the farm with Christmas cheer
To the animals living here,
Cluck cluck cluck- says the hen
Cluck cluck cluck- says the hen  

Out in the barnyard, tractor rides. 
Good old grandpa is our guide
All round the farm with Christmas cheer
To the animals living here,
Moo moo moo - says the cow
Moo moo moo - says the cow 

Out in the barnyard, tractor rides.

Lyrics:
Always by my side
Ready for a hug 
Ready for a kiss 
I see my shining star
And I whisper it a wish

Always by my side
Ready for a hug 
Ready for a kiss 
I see my shining star
And I whisper it a wish

It can be hard to share 
But then I see you smile
It‚Äôs like a big warm hug
Or coco in my mug
So I‚Äôll try my best to share  
To show you that I care

It can be hard to share 
But then I see you smile
It‚Äôs like a big warm hug
Or coco in my mug
‚ÄúCan I sleep with you and ‚Äústar star‚Äù tonight?!‚Äù - JJ
So I‚Äôll try my best to share
To show you that I care

It can be hard to share 
But then I see you smile
It‚Äôs like a big warm hug
Or coco in my mug
It turns out making you so happy
Makes me so happy too

Lyrics:
5,4,3,2,1
It‚Äôs time to have some fun
Get ready now to run  
Because here we come!

Oh hide-and-seek, hide-and-seek
Up on tiptoes we all creep
Hide-and-seek, hide-and-seek
Trying not to make a peep!

Look there in the snow
Some ears and a nose
On your tiptoes go, go, GO!
It‚Äôs hide-and-seek, in the snow!

Oh hide-and-seek, hide-and-seek
Up on tiptoes we all creep
Hide-and-seek, hide-and-seek
Trying not to make a peep!
 
Look there in the snow
Someone hiding low
On your tiptoes go, go, GO!
It‚Äôs hide-and-seek, in the snow!                                                       

5,4,3,2,1
It‚Äôs time to have some fun
Get ready now to run
Because here we coooOOOME!

Oh jingle bells, Jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh‚Ä¶ HEY!
Jingle bells, Jingle bells
Jingle all the way!
Oh what fun it is to ride

Lyrics:
For winter show and tell I love stockings full of treats!
And a star on top of the tree 

For winter show and tell I love popcorn and a movie
Stockings full of treats
And a star on top of the tree!

For winter show and tell I love yummy sugar cookies
Popcorn and a movie
Stockings full of treats
And a star on top of the tree!

For winter show and tell I love lights red and green
Yummy sugar cookies
Popcorn and a movie
Stockings full of treats
And a star on top of the tree!

For winter show and tell I love playing in the snow
Lights red and green
Yummy sugar cookies
Popcorn and a movie
Stockings full of treats
And a star on top of the tree!

For winter show and tell I love to dance ballet
Playing in the snow
Lights red and green
Yummy sugar cookies
Popcorn and a movie
Stockings full of treats
And a star on top of the tree!

For winter show and tell‚Ä¶
Pause in the music
For winter show and tell I love family time (slow! With a little pregnant pause at the end)
Tempo picks back up
Dancing Ballet
Playing in the snow
Lights red and green
Popcorn and a movie
Cookies so yummy
Stockings full of treats
And a star on top of the tree!

Lyrics:
It‚Äôs better to work together
Because it‚Äôs double the fun!
I have fun when you have fun
Yes! Share when you only have one!

‚ÄúOk boys, lets go inside‚Äù

Today‚Äôs our day to play
Having lots of fun
Playing with my dinosaur
Oh no we just have one!

When we work together everyone has more fun! 

It‚Äôs better to work together
Because it‚Äôs double the fun!
I have fun when you have fun
Yes! Share when you only have one!

Today‚Äôs our day to play
Though it‚Äôs almost done
I want the color blue
Oh no we just have one!

When we work together 
Everyone has more fun!

It‚Äôs better to work together
Because it‚Äôs double the fun!
I have fun when you have fun
Yes! Share when you only have one!

Today‚Äôs our day to play 
Out here in the sun  
Riding on the tricycle...
When we work together 
Everyone has more fun! 

‚Äú5, 4, 3, 2, 1 blastoff!‚Äù

It‚Äôs better to work together
Because it‚Äôs double the fun!
I have fun when you have fun
Yes! Share when you only have one!

Lyrics:
Autumn veggies start out small
With our help they grow up tall
Veggies help us grow up too 
That is why we love harvest stew!
 
I can‚Äôt find my carrots! Just this green stuff!
 
Carrots hide under the ground
Pull one up, what have you found?
A long and pointy, orange root 
For our harvest stew
 
Pumpkins sitting on the ground
Pick one up, what have you found?
Something heavy, round and smooth
For our harvest stew
 
My tomatoes are small and green!

Ms. Appleberry: They‚Äôre not ripe yet, but it‚Äôs ok, we can use mine!
 
Tomatoes resting on the vine
Pick one off, what did you find?
Something round, red and smooth!
For our harvest stew
 
Potatoes sleep under the ground
Pull one up, what have you found?
Something rough and hard to chew (spoken)
For our harvest stew 

Autumn veggies start out small
With our help they grow up tall
Veggies help us grow up too 
That is why we love harvest stew!

We‚Äôre going one-by-one!

We are going to find out
Who hides behind the desk
With a spooky... ‚ÄúBoo!‚Äù
‚Ä¶. Cece!
Halloween‚Äôs the best!

Where‚Äôs Miss Appleberry?

‚ÄúBoo!‚Äù
Miss Appleberry!

Let‚Äôs all play make-believe 
In costumes that we made
Let‚Äôs have a fall parade!

Jumped into a hole!

Popped out the other side   
Their ears in a bow! 

Make the tree - Cross the branches - loop the loop - pull tight!

Crisscross the tree 
Trying to catch me...

I want to tie tie tie my shoes

It took some time,Yes I tried and tried
Now I can get them tied!

Lyrics:
Let‚Äôs go for a nature walk
Listen to the birdies talk
Go strolling in the grass
While clouds go rolling past

**Whistles catchy tune**

Short and leafy forest trees  
Tall and pointy forest trees 
Forest trees stand happily 
As we‚Äôre whistling

**Whistles catchy tune**

Red and orange autumn leaves
Green and yellow autumn leaves
Autumn leaves dance in the breeze
As we‚Äôre whistling
 
**Whistles catchy tune**

Sweet and tiny flowers bloom
Big and happy flowers bloom
Can you smell their sweet perfume

As we‚Äôre whistling

**Whistles catchy tune**

Flapping, chirping birds go by
Swimming, quacking ducks go by
Floating free and flying high
As we‚Äôre whistling

**Whistles catchy tune**

We went for a nature walk
Listened to the birdies talk
Went strolling in the grass
While clouds went rolling past

**Whistles catchy tune**

One went to the market, one stayed at home and baked apple pie, and the other one had a roast beef! 

Lyrics:
Three hungry piggies
Rumble rumble rumble¬†
Their little tummies growl, growl, growl!
One tricky wolf¬†
Sneak sneak sneaks
He gives a hungry howl...

This little piggy went to market
To buy fruit of all kinds
This little piggy went to market
But the wolf said ‚Äúmine, mine, mine!‚Äù
¬†
This little piggy stayed at home~
He baked a yummy apple pie
This little piggy stayed at home~¬†
But the wolf said ‚Äúmine, mine, mine!‚Äù
¬†
Wally takes the roast beef
This little piggy had~ roast beef
He had them all, piled up high
This little piggy had~ roast beef
But the wolf said ‚Äúmine, mine, mine!‚Äù
¬†
These little piggies, they had none
The wolf took off, and ran away
These little piggies, they had none
So the piggies made a ‚Äúplan, plan, plan!‚Äù
¬†
These hungry piggies
Spoken: Plan plan plan
To get their dinner back
¬†
The hungry wolf went
Spoken: yum yum yum
The piggies tip-toed by! 
¬†
Three tricky piggies
Spoken: Sneak sneak sneak
Their little tummies growl‚Ä¶
¬†
This tricky wolf went ‚ÄúWah, wah, wah,‚Äù
Hungry and alone
These little piggies went ‚ÄúWee weee!
All the way... ‚Äúhome, home, home!‚Äù

Lyrics:
When it‚Äôs dark, no need to pout
You can take your flashlight out
Use your fingers, thumbs and all
So shadows play along the wall!
Place your hand up to the light
Your shadow dances in the night

Looky-look! a little snail
Crawling on the ground
Looky-look!  a bunny hops
Bouncing up and down

Looky-look! a silly goose
Eats berries one by one
Looky-look!  a hairy moose
The berries are all gone

With our thumbs and fingers too
We‚Äôll make a shadow puppet zoo!

Looky-look! A happy cow
Listen to her moo
Looky-look! a big gray wolf
Howling at the moon

Looky-look! An elephant!
His trunk sways to and fro
Looky-look! A Spooky Spider!
A Spider!? Yikes! Let‚Äôs Go!

When it‚Äôs dark, no need to pout
You can take your flashlight out
Use your fingers, thumbs and all
So shadows play along the wall!
Place your hand up to the light
Your shadow dances in the night

Lyrics:

When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
She‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre healthy
In every way

She‚Äôll check your weight, she‚Äôll check your height
She‚Äôll check to see that you‚Äôre growing right

When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
She‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre healthy
In every way

She‚Äôll check your lungs, she‚Äôll check your heart
She‚Äôll make sure they‚Äôre working, every part

When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
She‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre healthy
In every way

She‚Äôll check your eyes, she‚Äôll check your ears
She‚Äôll check how well you see and hear

When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
She‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre healthy
In every way

She‚Äôll check your mouth, she‚Äôll check your throat
She‚Äôll look at her checklist and make some notes

When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
She‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre healthy
In every way

She‚Äôll check your reflex, she‚Äôll check your bones
To see that they‚Äôre healthy, and how much you‚Äôve grown

When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
She‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre healthy
In every way

Now she might say that you need a shot
But don‚Äôt be scared, it won‚Äôt hurt a lot

When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
She‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre healthy
In every way

Growing, growing, little plants
So exciting, I could dance!
Just like magic, watch them grow
I love to watch our garden grow!

Let‚Äôs grab our shovels!

Spread some soil all around
So roots can grow deep in the ground
Grow and grow baby seeds
Grow up tall as can be!
 
Make a hole in the ground
Plant your seeds and pat them down
Grow and grow baby seeds,
Grow up tall as can be!

Plants get thirsty just like you
Water gently, that will do!
Grow and grow baby seeds,
Grow up tall as can be!

Plants get hungry, yes they do
They use the sun to make their food!        
Grow and grow baby seeds,
Grow up tall as can be!

Let‚Äôs be patient, wait and see!
One day they‚Äôll sprout up happily!
Grow and grow baby seeds,
Grow up tall as can be!

Where is our class pet?
Oh, where could she be?
We‚Äôre looking and looking  
Searching for clues
Where is...
Jelly Bean?

We‚Äôve lost the class pet
We‚Äôve lost Jelly Bean
She‚Äôs the softest thing
She squeaks when she sings  

We‚Äôve lost the class pet
We‚Äôve lost Jelly Bean
She has such tiny feet
Oh where could she be?

We‚Äôve lost the class pet
We‚Äôve lost Jelly Bean
She‚Äôs the softest thing
She squeaks when she sings

We‚Äôve lost the class pet
We‚Äôve lost Jelly Bean
She has such tiny feet
Oh where could she be?

We‚Äôve lost the class pet
We‚Äôve lost Jelly Bean

Jelly Bean!

This is our class pet
We found Jelly Bean
She has such tiny feet
She‚Äôs cuddly and sweet!

Instructions
To make a paper airplane we need:
A sheet of paper
Crayons
And that‚Äôs it! Are you ready?

Step 1. First, take your sheet of paper
Now find the SHORTER sides
Take one SHORT side, match it with the other
With one hand, HOLD the top
And with the other hand, make the fold

Step 2. Unfold your paper. Now find the LONG side
Is this the LONG side?
Take one CORNER and drag it to the MIDDLE fold
With one hand, HOLD the corner down
The other hand can make the fold
Now take the other CORNER
 Then drag it to the MIDDLE fold
With one hand, HOLD the corner down
And with the other hand, make the fold!

Step 3. See how it looks like a house?
Now fold it in half
 With the FLAPS on the OUTSIDE
Lay it on it‚Äôs side
Look! This is the MIDDLE POINT
Drag it down to match the BOTTOM fold
Use one hand to hold the point down
And with the other hand, make the fold!

Step 4. Now flip the whole thing over!
And we‚Äôll do the same thing on the other side
Find that MIDDLE POINT again
This one!
Then drag it down to match the bottom fold
Use one hand to hold the point down
And with the other hand, make the fold!

Step 5. Almost done!
Now let‚Äôs decorate our airplanes
And color it with our favorite things
Coco-you coco-me coco-1, 2, 3!

Step 6. Your airplane is ready!
Thanks for crafting with us!
See you again on Yoyo‚Äôs Arts and Crafts Time!

Let‚Äôs make our own construction site

We‚Äôll push and mix, smash and scoop

The big steam roller pounds the ground
Pounds it flat while rolling round
Rolling, Rolling! It‚Äôs so much fun
To get construction done
 
The concrete mixer blends and spins
All we need to make cement
Blending, Spinning, it‚Äôs so much fun
To get construction done

The rumbly dump truck drops and loads
What we need, down the road
Dropping, Loading, it‚Äôs so much fun
To get construction done

The great tall crane lowers and lifts 
Heavy things, smooth and swift
Lowering, Lifting, it‚Äôs so much fun
To get construction done

Let‚Äôs make our own construction site

We‚Äôll push and mix, smash and scoop

Lots of dirt, cement, and rocks
Scooping, Dropping, it‚Äôs so much fun

The big bulldozer pushes ‚Äòround
Dirt and rubble on the ground
Pushing, Pushing, it‚Äôs so much fun
To get construction done

We‚Äôll push and mix, smash and scoop

A brand new bed just for me-e-e
The coolest bed I‚Äôve ever se-e-en
I‚Äôve waited for so lo-o-ong
But wait! There‚Äôs something wrong!

Let‚Äôs build a bed for our big boy
A new bed that brings lots of joy
Our screws go in with a twist twist twist
Follow the steps on the list list list!

A brand new bed just for me-e-e
The coolest bed I‚Äôve ever se-e-en
I‚Äôve waited for so lo-o-ong
But wait! There‚Äôs something wrong!

Turn it clockwise, Righty-tighty 
Counterclockwise, Lefty-loosey
Righty-tighty, lefty-loosey
Wow! It‚Äôs really easy!

A brand new bed just for me-e-e
The coolest bed I‚Äôve ever se-e-en
I‚Äôve waited for so lo-o-ong
But wait! There‚Äôs something wrong!

We built a bed for our big boy
A bed that brings him lots of joy
The screws went in with a twist twist twist
Did all the steps on the list list list!

A brand new bed just for me-e-e
The coolest bed I‚Äôve ever se-e-en
I‚Äôve waited for so lo-o-ong
But wait! there‚Äôs something wrong!

We‚Äôve made a bed for our big boy
A bed that brings him lots of joy
Turn on the night light: one, two, three
So you can sleep and dream dream dream

When we make a bed of pillows, it makes me happy
When we‚Äôre safe inside our fort, it makes me happy
When all the stars are bright, it makes me happy

10 little eggs are cracking

10 dinosaurs in a row
Count them while they‚Äôre stretching
Count them all let‚Äôs go

It‚Äôs time to read now

Let‚Äôs all imagine!
It‚Äôs time to take a look!
Yes it‚Äôs my favorite time of day
Dad reads to me, Hip-hip-hooray!

I‚Äôm on a planet
I found some aliens
I‚Äôm on a spaceship
With all my new blue friends

It‚Äôs time to read now
I want to read a book
Let‚Äôs all imagine!
It‚Äôs time to take a look!
Yes it‚Äôs my favorite time of day
TomTom reads to me, Hip-hip-hooray!

I‚Äôm on a white horse
Holding my sword and shield
To fight the dragon
Down on the battlefield

It‚Äôs time to read now
I want to read a book
Let‚Äôs all imagine!
It‚Äôs time to take a look!
Yes it‚Äôs my favorite time of day
Mom reads to me, Hip-hip-hooray!

You‚Äôre on some pink clouds
They‚Äôre cotton candy 
I‚Äôm on some pink clouds
With fuzzy bunnies

Lyrics:

My baby tooth is loose today
Am I going to be okay?

Don‚Äôt you worry, it‚Äôs okay

If you leave your tooth alone
Your tooth will fall out on its own
Your baby teeth will fall away
But new teeth will grow -- someday
   
Wiggle Wiggle! Is it ready?   
Wiggle Wiggle! Is it ready? 
Wiggle, Wiggle, no not yet    
My baby tooth‚Äôs not ready yet

Wiggle Wiggle! Is it ready?
Wiggle Wiggle! Is it ready? 
Wiggle Wiggle, getting close!  
My baby tooth is getting close!

If I leave my tooth alone
My tooth will fall out on its own
My baby teeth will fall away
But new teeth will grow -- someday

Look my tooth is loose, see?

Wiggle Wiggle! Is it ready?
Wiggle Wiggle! Is it ready? 
Wiggle Wiggle almost there!  
My baby tooth is almost there!

Wiggle Wiggle Is it ready?
Wiggle Wiggle! Is it ready? 
Wiggle Wiggle!‚∏∫
It came out! 

My baby tooth came out today (He holds up his tooth)
But I‚Äôm not sad, Hip-Hip-Hooray!
My brand new tooth will grow and grow
I won‚Äôt be TOOTHLESS anymore!

Lyrics:

We all have five senses
Hearing, sight and smell
We all have five senses
Touch and taste as well
  
Close your eyes! Let‚Äôs hear with our ears!

This sound‚Äôs high and squeaky
Hmmm...A rubber duck! 
It‚Äôs fun to hear with our ears!

Let‚Äôs look with our eyes!

This looks red and spotty
Lots of spots
Like polka dots
Hmmm‚Ä¶A ladybug!
It‚Äôs fun to look with our eyes!
 
Let‚Äôs touch with our hands!

This feels wet and squishy
Hmmm‚Ä¶It‚Äôs jello!
It‚Äôs fun to feel with our hands!

We all have five senses
Hearing, sight and smell
We all have five senses
Touch and taste as well

Let‚Äôs taste with our mouths!

This tastes sour and tangy!
Hmmm‚Ä¶A lemon! 
It‚Äôs fun to taste with our mouths!  

Let‚Äôs smell with our noses!

This smells sweet and yummy
Mmmm...Cinnamon rolls! 
It‚Äôs fun to smell with our noses, yeah!

We all have five senses
Hearing, sight and smell
We all have five senses
Touch and taste as well

Doing things like work or play
Is there something you should do
Before you‚Äôre on your way?

Freeze! Stop and think!
There are germs that you can‚Äôt see

Wash wash wash your hands
Let the bubbles do their dance
Scrub scrub scrub-a-dub
Now you're in the clean hands club! 

When you spend your happy days
Doing things like work or play
Is there something you should do
Before you‚Äôre on your way?

Freeze! Stop and think! 
Aren‚Äôt you forgetting something?

Wash wash wash your hands
Let the bubbles do their dance
Scrub scrub scrub-a-dub
Now you're in the clean hands club! 

When you spend your happy days
Doing things like work or play
Is there something you should do
Before you‚Äôre on your way?

Freeze! Stop and think!
There are germs that you can‚Äôt see

Wash wash wash your hands
Let the bubbles do their dance
Scrub scrub scrub-a-dub
Now you're in the clean hands club!

When you spend your happy days
Doing things like work or play
Is there something you should do
Before you‚Äôre on your way?

Freeze! Stop and think! 
Aren‚Äôt you forgetting something?

Wash wash wash your hands
Let the bubbles do their dance
Scrub scrub scrub-a-dub
Now you're in the clean hands club!

It‚Äôs fun to ski side to side
On a white and snowy ride
Sliding down the bunny slope
Soaring, smiling wide

Place your boot in from the toe
Then you push your heel down low
Everyone let‚Äôs Go! Go! Go!
We‚Äôll have fun out in the snow!

Do the duck walk in your skis
Form your skis into a ‚ÄúV‚Äù
Everyone let‚Äôs Go! Go! Go!
We‚Äôll have fun out in the snow!

We love to ski! We love it all!  
As the dancing snowflakes fall 
It‚Äôs fun to ski side to side 
On a white and snowy ride

Make a pizza shape, okay
Help your skis to make an ‚ÄúA‚Äù
Everyone let‚Äôs Go! Go! Go!
We‚Äôll have fun out in the snow!

Ride the magic carpet up
Then we‚Äôll ski down from the top 
Everyone let‚Äôs Go! Go! Go! 
We‚Äôll have fun out in the snow!

We love to ski! We love it all!  
As the dancing snowflakes fall 
It‚Äôs fun to ski side to side 
On a white and snowy ride

Let‚Äôs go down the bunny slope 
Not too fast and not too slow
Everyone let‚Äôs Go! Go! Go!
We‚Äôll have fun out in the snow! 

We love to ski! We love it all!  
As the dancing snowflakes fall 
It‚Äôs fun to ski side to side 
On a white and snowy ride

Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
'Tis the season to be jolly

Don we now our gay apparel
Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
Troll the ancient Yule-tide carol
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

Dashing through the snow,
In a one-horse open sleigh,
O‚Äôer the fields we go,
Laughing all the way (ha, ha, ha)

Bells on bobtail ring,
Making spirits bright,
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight (Oh!)

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, hey!

Jingle bells, jingle bells, 
Jingle all the way!
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh!

We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year

Good tidings we bring to you and your kin
Good tidings for Christmas and a Happy New Year

Lyrics:
Five little eggs were sitting in the nest
On top of the tree and all at rest
Mama bird saw them starting to crack
And soon all the eggs were hatched

The 1st baby bird looked down at the ground
He got scared and couldn‚Äôt make a sound
Mama bird said now fly fly fly
But the baby bird was too shy shy shy  

The 1st baby bird got out of the nest
The Next baby bird looked at the rest 
Mama bird said now fly fly fly
But the baby bird said oh my my my

The 2nd baby bird flew way up high 
The Next baby bird then gave a sigh
Mama bird said now fly fly fly
But the baby bird said too high high high 

The 3rd baby bird at last went out
The Next baby bird then gave a pout
Mama bird said now fly fly fly
But the baby bird said oh why why why 

The 4th baby bird went down to eat 
The Last baby bird gave a long loud tweet
Mama bird said now fly fly fly
But the baby bird wanted to cry cry cry 

Mama bird said it‚Äôll be okay, 
you‚Äôll be alright and there‚Äôs a way  
The Little baby bird then started to sing 
And flew off flapping his wings 

All the baby birds with mother in the lead
Flew through the sky quite well indeed
Mama bird said now fly fly fly
And all the birds flew to the sky sky sky

One, two, three, four, five,
Once I caught a fish alive,
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
Then I let it go again.

Why did you let it go?
Because it bit my finger so.
Which finger did it bite?
This little finger on my right.

These are the things that 
Live at the beach
It‚Äôs so fun to learn what
Lives at the beach!
These are the things that 
Live at the beach!
I love the things at the beach!

I look in the sky and what do I see?
A white seagull flies over me.
Soaring, diving, flap, flap, flap
Flap like the seagull, flap, flap, flap

I look at the sand and what do I see?
A little red crab walks right by me
Crawling, Creeping, click click clack
Crawl like a crab, go click click clack

I look in the tidepool and what do I see?
Clamshells yawn in the deep blue sea
Opening, Closing, snap snap snap
Snap like a clam go snap, snap, snap

I look at the shore and what do I see?
A sea turtle wiggles on the sandy beach 
Flippers waving, swish, swish, swish
Wave like a turtle, swish, swish, swish

I look at the beach and what do I see?
Dolphins play in the waves so free
Jumping, diving, splish, splish, splash
Jump like a dolphin, splish, splish, splash

Eyes ears elbows neck & nose
Feet knees hands arms legs & toes
Fingers mouth head hair & hips
I love my body the way it is 

This is my head, My favorite thing
And what I love Is when it‚Äôs thinking
These are my eyes, My favorite thing
And what I love is when they‚Äôre reading

These are my toes, My favorite thing
And what I love is when they‚Äôre wiggling
This is my hair, My favorite thing
And what I love is when it‚Äôs bouncing

These are my fingers, My favorite thing
And what I love is when they‚Äôre snapping
These are my shoulders, My favorite thing
And what I love is when they‚Äôre shaking

These are my arms, My favorite thing
And what I love is when they‚Äôre hugging
These are my feet, My favorite thing
And what I love is when they‚Äôre dancing

These are my ears, My favorite thing
And what I love is when they‚Äôre hearing
These are my hips, My favorite thing
And what I love is when they‚Äôre swinging

These are my legs, My favorite thing
And what I love is when they‚Äôre jumping
These are my hands, My favorite thing
And what I love is when they‚Äôre clapping

This is my nose, My favorite thing
And what I love is when it‚Äôs smelling
This is my mouth, My favorite thing
And what I love is when it‚Äôs whistling

Lyrics:

When someone‚Äôs in trouble 
And they need your help
Make sure they‚Äôre okay 
When someone‚Äôs in trouble 
And they need your help
What‚Äôs the thing to say?
You say‚Ä¶

How can I help?
What can I do?
I want to do a nice thing for you
How can I help?
What can I do?
To make things better for you

Lyrics:

We‚Äôll go out to the field today
We‚Äôre going to run and play
We‚Äôll be on a team and have a race 
We‚Äôll have so much fun

We went out to the field today
We went out to run and play
We were on a team and had a race
We had so much fun

Jump on the ball and bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce as fast as you can
Jump on the ball and bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce bounce as fast as you can

Let‚Äôs grab the rope and tug, tug, tug
Tug, tug, as hard as you can
Let‚Äôs grab the rope and tug, tug, tug
Tug tug  as hard as you can

Put on the sack and jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump as fast as you can
Put on the sack and jump, jump, jump
Jump jump as fast as you can

Pick up a bean bag, toss, toss, toss
Toss, toss as close as you can
Pick up a bean bag, toss, toss, toss
Toss toss as close as you can

Take the baton and run, run, run
Run, run as fast as you can
Take the baton and run, run, run
Run run as fast as you can

He‚Äôs the best, he‚Äôs the best I know

My big brother makes me laugh

He makes them work and run and go
My big brother fixes things
He‚Äôs the best, the best I know

My big brother helps me out
With school and things that I don‚Äôt know
My big brother helps me out
He‚Äôs the best, the best I know

To laugh and play and run
When we do things together
It‚Äôs always much more fun

Lyrics:

I have a Puppy
His name is Bingo
I have a Puppy
Cute as a rainbow!

I love his tail 
and smiling face
He makes me happy
In any place!

‚ÄúCome Bingo!‚Äù
‚ÄúGood Boy!‚Äù

We run and play
If he could pick,
His favorite game
Is ‚ÄúGet the stick!‚Äù

‚ÄúBingo! Fetch!‚Äù   
‚ÄúGood Boy!‚Äù

I lost my lamb  
The other day 
Bingo found it! 
‚ÄúHip Hip Hooray!‚Äù

‚ÄúGive Bingo!‚Äù
‚ÄúGood Boy!‚Äù

I train him to 
Do some cool tricks 
He is so smart   
He learns them quick! 

‚ÄúShake Bingo!‚Äù
‚ÄúGood Boy!‚Äù

And on the days
Bingo is bad
I wag my finger
It makes him sad

‚ÄúNo Bingo!‚Äù
‚ÄúNext time, outside‚Äù

When I am sick  
Or feeling blue  
He stays by me  
Through and through 

‚ÄúThanks Bingo‚Äù

We love our Puppy
Yes, it is true.
We love our Puppy
He loves us too.

Lyrics:

Come on let‚Äôs go
Today is hot, so,
We‚Äôll have some fun out in the sun
The sand and sea‚Äôs the place to be

Let‚Äôs build, build, build a castle
Build, build, build a castle
Let‚Äôs build, build, build a castle
We‚Äôre playing at the beach

Let‚Äôs splash, splash, splash in the waves
Splash, splash, splash in the waves
Let‚Äôs splash, splash, splash in the waves
We‚Äôre playing at the beach

Let‚Äôs bounce, bounce, bounce a beach ball
Bounce, bounce, bounce a beach ball
Let‚Äôs bounce, bounce, bounce a beach ball
We‚Äôre playing at the beach

Let‚Äôs fly, fly, fly a kite
Fly, fly, fly a kite
Let‚Äôs fly, fly, fly a kite
We‚Äôre playing at the beach

Make a funny face, make a funny face
Move your eyes, your mouth, your nose, 
Make a funny face

Make a happy face, with a great big smile!
A happy face!  A happy face!
A happy face!  A happy face!

Make a sad face, with a tear and a pout!
A sad face!  A sad face!
A sad face!  A sad face!

Make an angry face, with a great big frown!
An angry face!  An angry face!
An angry face!  An angry face!

Make a surprised face, with your mouth open wide!
A surprised face!  A surprised face!
A surprised face!  A surprised face!

Make a cute face, as nice as can be!
A cute face!  A cute face!
A cute face!  A cute face!

Make a silly face, as funny as you can!
A silly face!  A silly face!
A silly face!  A silly face!

Lyrics:

My Daddy is the best, the best there ever was
My Daddy is the best, and I love him just because
He tells me silly stories and tucks me in at night
He helps me not to be afraid when he turns out the light

My Daddy is the best, the best there ever was
My Daddy is the best, and I love him just because
He‚Äôs always playing music, and lets me sing along
He also dances with me, and sings my favorite songs

My Daddy is the best, the best there ever was
My Daddy is the best, and I love him just because
He always takes us places, like camping or on hikes
He taught me how to catch a fish and helped me ride my bike

Your Daddy is the best, the best there ever was
Your Daddy is the best, and I love him just because
He listens to my problems, he knows just what to do
He‚Äôs my biggest hero,  It‚Äôs true!

Our Daddy is the best, the best there ever was
Our Daddy is the best, and we love him just because
He always takes good care of us, he‚Äôs kind as he can be
He‚Äôs the greatest Daddy that we have ever seen!

I love to be your Daddy
Really?  It‚Äôs true!
You fill my life with lots of joy
You‚Äôre my favorite girls and boys!
Really?  It‚Äôs true!
I love you!

My Mommy is the best, the best there ever was
My Mommy is the best, and I love her just because
Whenever I am sick or hurt, she gives a great big kiss
She helps me to feel better and she does it just like this

My Mommy is the best, the best there ever was
My Mommy is the best, and I love her just because
She takes the time to play with me, all my favorite games
Even when she‚Äôs busy, she loves me just the same

My Mommy is the best, the best there ever was
My Mommy is the best, and I love her just because
Whenever I get hungry, she makes my favorite snacks
She makes them just the way I like, they‚Äôre great and that‚Äôs a fact

Your Mommy is the best, the best there ever was
Your Mommy is the best, and I love her just because
She laughs when I am silly, and likes to play along
We sing and dance together to all our favorite songs

Our Mommy is the best, the best there ever was
Our Mommy is the best, and we love her just because
She always takes good care of us, and she should be a queen
She‚Äôs the greatest mommy that we have ever seen

I love to be your mommy
Really?  It‚Äôs true!
You fill my life with lots of joy
You are my precious girl and boys
Really?  It‚Äôs true!
I love you!

The ants go marching one by one, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching one by one, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching one by one,
The little one stops to suck his thumb
and they all go marching down to the ground
To get out of the rain, BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

The ants go marching two by two, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching two by two, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching two by two,
The little one stops to tie his shoe
And they all go marching down to the ground
To get out of the rain, BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

The ants go marching three by three, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching three by three, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching three by three,
The little one stops to climb a tree
And they all go marching down to the ground
To get out of the rain, BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
 
The ants go marching four by four, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching four by four, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching four by four,
The little one stops to shut the door
And they all go marching down to the ground
To get out of the rain, BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

The ants go marching five by five, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching five by five, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching five by five,
The little one stops to check the skies
And they all go marching down to the ground
To get out of the rain, BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

The ants go marching six by six, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching six by six, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching six by six,
The little one stops to pick up sticks
And they all go marching down to the ground

Lyrics:

When you get that funny feeling
Way down low
Just stop what you‚Äôre doing
And go go go!

What are you doing?  Where did you go?
What are you doing?  I want to know!
I went to the potty, and washed my hands too
I went to the potty like the big kids do!

How do I do that?  How do I go? 
How do I do that?  I want to know!
Just sit on the potty, sit and wait
Sit on the potty and it will be great!

I‚Äôm sitting on the potty, ready to go
But nothing is happening, and why, I don‚Äôt know
Try again later, it‚Äôs okay,
Try again later, later today

I‚Äôve got the funny feeling, way down low
I‚Äôve got the funny feeling, I think I have to go!
Just sit on the potty, sit and wait
Sit on the potty and it will be great!

I went to the potty!  Look and see!
I went to the potty, hooray for me!
Great job, J.J., now wash your hands!
Great job, J.J., now do the potty dance!

Great job, J.J., do the potty dance
I/we got you some big boy underpants
When you get that funny feeling way down low, 
Stop what you‚Äôre doing and go, go, go!

My teacher is the best, the best there ever was
My teacher is the best, and I love her just because
She always tells me stories, and reads my favorite books
When I want to see the pictures, she always lets me look

My teacher is the best, the best there ever was
My teacher is the best, and I love her just because
She helps us all to get along, and teaches us to share
She taught me always to be kind, and always to play fair

My teacher is the best, the best there ever was,
My teacher is the best, and I love her just because
Sometimes I fall and hurt myself, and then I start to cry,
But she helps me to feel better, and helps me dry my eyes

My teacher is the best, the best there ever was
My teacher is the best, and I love her just because
She teaches us to dance, and she teaches us to sing
She teaches us some silly songs, and it‚Äôs my favorite thing

My teacher is the best, the best there ever was
My teacher is the best, and I love her just because
When I spill and make a mess, my teacher helps me clean
She‚Äôs the greatest teacher that I have ever seen

He‚Äôll check how well you see and hear

He‚Äôll check your mouth, he‚Äôll check your throat
He‚Äôll look at his checklist and make some notes

He‚Äôll check your reflex, he‚Äôll check your bones
To see that they‚Äôre healthy, and how much you‚Äôve grown

Now he might say that you need a shot
But don‚Äôt be scared, it won‚Äôt hurt a lot

Lyrics:

In the summer the ants were a-working
Bringing food to their hill every day
While the grasshopper sang in the sunshine
On his fiddle, his song he did play.

‚ÄúFi-de-di, de-dah-doo, dah-de da-do
Fi-de-do, de-da-dee, de-da-day
I will sing all the while ‚Äòneath the sunshine!
‚ÄòNeath the moon, I will dance, I will play!‚Äù

In the autumn the ants were still working
But the grasshopper still did not care
The ants asked ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you store food for winter?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhen it‚Äôs cold, you‚Äôll have no food to spare.‚Äù

‚ÄúFi-de-di, de-dah-doo, dah-de da-do
Fi-de-do, de-da-dee, de-da-day
‚ÄòBove us all, there will always be sunshine
And there always will be time to play!‚Äù

Time went by, and along came the winter
And the wind gave a cold icy chill
Snow fell down, and there was no more sunshine
So the grasshopper went up the hill.

‚ÄúFi-de-di, de-dah-doo, dah-de da-do
Fi-de-do, de-da-dee, de-da-day
I am cold, I am wet, I am hungry
And I‚Äôm sorry I played the days away.‚Äù

In the valley he went to the anthill
He was cold, and embarrassed, and sad
But the ants told him that he was welcome
Then he thanked them and felt really glad!

‚ÄúFi-de-di, de-dah-doo, dah-de da-do
Fi-de-do, de-da-dee, de-da-day!‚Äù
And the grasshopper said in future seasons
Work comes first, then he‚Äôll have time to play!

Then there were four green speckled frogs

Eating some most delicious bugs (yum, yum)
One jumped into the pool

Then there were three green speckled frogs

Three little speckled frogs

Two little speckled frogs

Eating some most delicious bugs (yum, yum)

One little speckled frog
Sat on a speckled log

The Tortoise and the Hare | CoComelon Nursery Rhymes & Kids Songs,2018-07-13T07:00:03Z,PT3M59S,1584589146,4321254,N/A,Cocomelon - Nursery Rhymes,UCbCmjCuTUZos6Inko4u57UQ,"Who‚Äôs going to win the race, the speedy hare, or the slow tortoise?  Have fun singing along with this classic story! (Alt title: The Hare and the Tortoise)
https://www.youtube.com/c/Cocomelon?sub_confirmation=1

Lyrics: 
Once there was a very very speedy hare
Once there was a very very speedy hare
He would brag from near and far 
That he was faster than a car
Oh yes, one time there was a very speedy hare

The plucky tortoise said to Hare, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have a race,‚Äù
The plucky tortoise said to Hare, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have a race,‚Äù
‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre so fast in running shoes,
Then there‚Äôs no way that you can lose,‚Äù
Oh yes, the tortoise said to Hare ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have a race‚Äù

Fast and slow, fast and slow!
Who will win?  Let‚Äôs watch them go! 
Down the road, around the tree!
Who will win?  Just wait and see!

All the animals came down to see them run
All the animals came down to see them run
With a bell the race began
And fast away the quick hare ran
Oh yes, the animals came down to see them run

The lagging tortoise very slowly crawled along
The lagging tortoise very slowly crawled along
Since the hare so quickly sped,
He had by now run far ahead
Oh yes, the tortoise very slowly crawled along

Fast and slow, fast and slow!
Who will win?  Let‚Äôs watch them go! 
Down the road, around the tree!
Who will win?  Just wait and see!

The speedy hare felt very sure that he would win
The speedy hare felt very sure that he would win
Since he thought he couldn‚Äôt lose,
He laid right down to take a snooze
Oh yes, the hare felt very sure that he would win

The little tortoise kept on inching down the road
The little tortoise kept on inching down the road
He passed by the sleeping hare,
Who kept on snoring, unaware
Oh yes, the tortoise kept on inching down the road

Fast and slow, fast and slow!
Who will win?  Let‚Äôs watch them go! 
Down the road, around the tree!
Who will win?  Just wait and see!

Determined Tortoise nearly reached the finish line
Determined Tortoise nearly reached the finish line
The sleepy hare woke up and ran
As fast as speedy quick hares can
Oh yes, the tortoise nearly reached the finish line

Yes it‚Äôs true that slow and steady wins the race
Yes it‚Äôs true that slow and steady wins the race
Oh yes the hare was very fast
But even so, he came in last
Oh yes it‚Äôs true that slow and steady wins the race

Lyrics: 

CHORUS 
Clean up, clean up
We all had fun today
Now it‚Äôs time to clean up and
Put everything away!  

Over here and over there
Up and down and everywhere
All the toys and games we played
And one big giant mess we made

Over here and over there
Up and down and everywhere
There‚Äôs cars and trucks and boats and trains
And buses and a model plane

Over here and over there
Up and down and everywhere
There‚Äôs paper, brushes, paints and glue
And lots of pictures that we drew

Over here and over there
Up and down and everywhere
There‚Äôs shoes and socks and balls and bats
And shirts and capes and silly hats

Lyrics: 

Mary had a little lamb
Little lamb, little lamb
Mary had a little lamb
Its fleece was white as snow

And everywhere that Mary went
Mary went, Mary went
Everywhere that Mary went 
The lamb was sure to go

He followed her to school one day
School one day, school one day
He followed her to school one day
Which was against the rules

It made the children laugh and play
Laugh and play, laugh and play
It made the children laugh and play
To see a lamb at school

So the teacher turned him out
Turned him out, turned him out
So the teacher turned him out
But still he lingered near

And he waited patiently
Patiently, patiently
And he waited patiently
‚ÄòTill Mary did appear

Why does the lamb love Mary so?
Love Mary so, love Mary so?
Why does the lamb love Mary so?
The eager children cried

Why, Mary loves the lamb you know
Lamb you know, lamb you know
Why, Mary loves the lamb you know
The teacher did reply

Lyrics:
All the animals are playing in the band
They‚Äôre having so much fun!
The piano is so grand,
You play it with your hands
It goes:

All the animals are playing in the band
They‚Äôre having so much fun!
The guitar, it has six strings,
You can play it while you sing
It goes:

All the animals are playing in the band
They‚Äôre having so much fun!
Play the drums and keep the beat
With your hands and with your feet
It goes:

All the animals are playing in the band
They‚Äôre having so much fun!
Violin is high, not low
And you play it with a bow
It goes:

All the animals are playing in the band
They‚Äôre having so much fun!
The tuba sounds so low,
So take a breath and blow
It goes:

All the animals are playing in the band
They‚Äôre having so much fun!
When you play upon a flute
It makes a happy toot,
It goes:

All the animals are playing in the band
They‚Äôre having so much fun!
Play the xylophone with sticks
The notes are short and quick
It goes:

All the animals are playing in the band
They‚Äôre having so much fun!
The harmonica is small
The smallest one of all
It goes:

All the animals are playing in the band
They‚Äôre having so much fun!
They all play with the beat
As they‚Äôre marching down the street
They go:

Rock a bye Baby in the tree top
When the wind blows, the cradle will rock
When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall
And down will come baby, cradle and all

Baby is drowsing, cozy and fair
Mother sits near in her rocking chair
Forward and back the cradle she swings
Though baby sleeps, he hears what she sings

Rock a bye Baby, do not you fear
Never mind, Baby, Mother is near
Wee little fingers, eyes are shut tight
Now sound asleep until morning light

Hold your breath (*Hiccup!*)
Hold your breath (*Hiccup!*)
If you really, really, really wanna stop

When you start to have the hiccups ‚Äòcause you ate your food too fast
And you really really really wanna stop
Just take a drink of water, you can sip it from a glass
If you really really really wanna stop

Take a sip (*Hiccup!*) 
Take a sip (*Hiccup!*)
If you really, really, really wanna stop
Take a sip (*Hiccup!*)
Take a sip (*Hiccup!*)
If you really, really, really wanna stop

When you start to have the hiccups and you don‚Äôt feel very well
And you really really really wanna stop
Just ask a friend to help you, to sneak up on you and yell
If you really really really wanna stop

Go get spooked (BOO! *Hiccup!*)
Go get spooked (BOO! *Hiccup!*)
If you really, really, really wanna stop
Go get spooked (BOO! *Hiccup!*)
Go get spooked (BOO! *Hiccup!*)
If you really, really, really wanna stop

When you start to have the hiccups and they won‚Äôt leave you alone
And you really really really wanna stop
Just wait a little while, they might leave you on their own
If you really really really wanna stop

Wait it out (*Hiccup!*)
Wait it out 
If you really, really, really wanna stop
Wait it out 
Wait it out 
If you really, really, really wanna stop

The bear went over the mountain
The bear went over the mountain
The bear went over the mountain
To see what he could see

And all that he could see
And all that he could see

Was the other side of the mountain
The other side of the mountain
The other side of the mountain 
Was all that he could see

The bear went over the river
The bear went over the river
The bear went over the river
To see what he could see

And all that he could see
And all that he could see

Was the other side of the river
The other side of the river
The other side of the river
Was all that he could see

The bear went into the forest
The bear went into the forest
The bear went into the forest
To see what he could see

And all that he could see
And all that he could see

Was the other side of the forest
The other side of the forest
The other side of the forest
Was all that he could see

The bear went back to the treehouse
The bear went back to the treehouse
The bear went back to the treehouse
To see what he could see

And all that he could see
And all that he could see

Was the stuffy right there in the toy box
The stuffy right there in the toy box
The stuffy right there in the toy box
Was all that he could see

Lyrics:

The three little kittens, they lost their mittens,
And they began to cry.
‚ÄúOh Mother dear, we sadly fear,
Our mittens we have lost.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat?  Lost your mittens?  You naughty kittens,
Then you shall have no pie.‚Äù
‚ÄúMeow, meow, meow, meow,
Then we shall have no pie.‚Äù

The three little kittens, they found their mittens,
And they began to cry,
‚ÄúOh Mother dear, see here, see here,
Our mittens we have found!‚Äù
‚ÄúPut on your mittens, you silly kittens,
And you shall have some pie.‚Äù
‚ÄúMeow, meow, meow, meow,
Then we shall have some pie.‚Äù

The three little kittens put on their mittens
And soon ate up the pie.
‚ÄúOh Mother dear, we greatly fear,
Our mittens we have soiled.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat?  Soiled your mittens?  You naughty kittens!‚Äù
Then they began to sigh.
‚ÄúMeow, meow, meow, meow,
Then they began to sigh.

The three little kittens, they washed their mittens
And hung them out to dry.
‚ÄúOh Mother dear, see here, see here,
Our mittens we have washed.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat?  Washed your mittens?  Such good little kittens,
I smell a wolf close by.‚Äù
‚ÄúMeow, meow, meow, meow,
We smell a wolf close by.‚Äù

Lyrics:
There was a Country Mouse who loved the country
There was a City Mouse who loved the city
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

The Country Mouse liked to eat oats and beans
The City Mouse liked to eat cake and cheese
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

The Country Mouse listened to the bugs and birds
The City Mouse listened to the cars and trucks
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

The Country Mouse looked at the moon and stars
The City Mouse looked at the signs and lights
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

The Country Mouse lived near the fields and trees
The City Mouse lived near the shops and streets
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

The Country Mouse invited the City Mouse
The City Mouse visited the Country Mouse
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

The Country Mouse showed his friend the country 
The City Mouse talked about the city
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

The Country Mouse said, ‚ÄúPlease feel at home‚Äù
The City Mouse wanted to go back home
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

The City Mouse invited the Country Mouse
The Country Mouse visited the City Mouse
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

The City Mouse showed his friend the city
The Country Mouse was chased by a kitty
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

The City Mouse said, ‚ÄúPlease feel at home‚Äù
The Country Mouse wanted to go back home
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

There was a Country Mouse who loved the country
There was a City Mouse who loved the city
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

There were ten in the bed
And the little one said
Roll over, roll over
So they all rolled over and one fell out

There were nine in the bed
And the little one said
Roll over, roll over
So they all rolled over and one fell out

There were eight in the bed
And the little one said
Roll over, roll over
So they all rolled over and one fell out

There were seven in the bed
And the little one said
Roll over, roll over
So they all rolled over and one fell out

There were six in the bed
And the little one said
Roll over, roll over
So they all rolled over and one fell out

There were five in the bed
And the little one said
Roll over, roll over
So they all rolled over and one fell out

There were four in the bed
And the little one said
Roll over, roll over
So they all rolled over and one fell out

There were three in the bed
And the little one said
Roll over, roll over
So they all rolled over and one fell out

There were two in the bed
And the little one said
Roll over, roll over
So they all rolled over and one fell out

There was one in the bed
And the little one said
I‚Äôm lonely, now I miss my friends

There was one in the bed
And the animals said
Come over, come over
So he walked on over and they all felt good

Good night, good night

Lyrics:
 
Three little pigs went out one day
One built a house made out of hay
The other pigs thought it would fall, fall, fall
But the first didn‚Äôt care at all.
 
Three little pigs went out one day
The second used sticks to build away
The third pig thought it would fall, fall, fall
But the second didn‚Äôt care at all.
 
Three little pigs went out one day
For the third pig, bricks were the way
He knew the house wouldn‚Äôt fall, fall, fall
So the work didn‚Äôt bother him at all.
 
Then came a wolf who was big and bad
He was incredibly hungry and mad
The three little pigs saw the wolf that day
They slammed their doors and hid away
 
‚ÄúLittle pig, little pig, let me in!‚Äù
‚ÄúNot by the hair on my chinny-chin chin!‚Äù
‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll huff and I‚Äôll puff, and I‚Äôll blow, blow, blow!‚Äù
And boy, did the hay house go!
 
‚ÄúLittle pigs, little pigs, let me in!‚Äù
‚ÄúNot by the hair on our chinny-chin chins!‚Äù
‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll huff and I‚Äôll puff, and I‚Äôll blow, blow, blow!‚Äù
And boy, did the stick house go!
 
‚ÄúLittle pigs, little pigs, let me in!‚Äù
‚ÄúNot by the hair on our chinny-chin chins !‚Äù
‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll huff and I‚Äôll puff, and I‚Äôll blow, blow, blow!‚Äù
But the bricks surely did not go!
 
The wolf was at his wit‚Äôs end, you see
He climbed on the roof, down the brick chimney!
He came with his teeth all bared, bared, bared
So the three little pigs got scared!
 
The third little pig lit a log on fire
The smoke started rising, higher and higher
The wolf burned his hairy tail, OW! OW! OW!
And the wolf ran out of town!
 
The two little piggies of hay and sticks
Learned a lesson all about work and bricks
A hard-worked job won‚Äôt fall fall fall
To a huff, or a puff, at all!
 
The three little pigs went out that day
Now they were free to laugh and play
The Big Bad Wolf was gone gone gone
And the little pigs danced ‚Äòtil dawn!

Lyrics:
Here come the blue whales, baby and mom
They swim in the ocean, peaceful and calm
The fishies swim by, and all wave hello
To their good friend who‚Äôs  big and so slow

Here come the blue whales, baby and mom
They swim in the ocean, peaceful and calm
They twirl in the water using their fins
It makes them so happy, see how they grin

Here come the blue whales, baby and mom
They swim in the ocean, peaceful and calm
Mom nudges baby with her big snout,
Then up to the surface, breathe with a spout

Here come the blue whales, baby and mom
They swim in the ocean, peaceful and calm
They‚Äôre happy together all the day long,
They swim in the ocean, singing this song

Lyrics:

Look what I found on the very top stair
Look what I found up there!
It looks like a box and it‚Äôs filled with socks,
Oh look what I found up there!

How many pairs do you think we‚Äôll find, 
How many pairs inside?
We‚Äôll look through the box and match all the socks
Oh how many pairs inside?

I found a sock, believe it or not,
With big yellow polka dots!
We‚Äôll look through the batch ‚Äòtill we find a match
For big yellow polka dots!

I found a sock, it was almost lost,
That‚Äôs fuzzy wuzzy, warm and soft!
We‚Äôll look through the batch ‚Äòtill we find a match
For fuzzy wuzzy, warm and soft!

I found a sock of a different type
With orange and purple stripes!
We‚Äôll look through the batch ‚Äòtill we find a match
For orange and purple stripes!

I found a sock, and it makes me glad,
It‚Äôs red and blue in plaid!
We‚Äôll look through the batch ‚Äòtill we find a match
For red and blue in plaid!

I found a sock, that‚Äôs how it goes
With holes for all my toes!
We‚Äôll look through the batch ‚Äòtill we find a match
For holes for all my toes!

I found a sock so my feet won‚Äôt freeze
All the way up to my knees!
We‚Äôll look through the batch ‚Äòtill we find a match
For all the way up to my knees!

I found a sock, you bet, that‚Äôs right,
That‚Äôs just plain gray and white
We‚Äôll look through the batch ‚Äòtill we find a match 
For just plain gray and white

We came at last to the bottom of the box, 
To the bottom of the box of socks!
Look at all the pairs that we found in there,
It‚Äôs the bottom of the box of socks!

Lyrics:
Ten T-Rexes in the gym, in the gym
Ten T-Rexes in the gym, in the gym
One fell down, and they tumbled over him,
Ten T-Rexes in the gym, in the gym!

Nine T-Rexes jumping rope, jumping rope
Nine T-Rexes jumping rope, jumping rope
One fell down, he‚Äôs so tangled there‚Äôs no hope,
No T-Rexes jumping rope, jumping rope!  

Eight T-Rexes on the beam, on the beam
Eight T-Rexes on the beam, on the beam
One fell down, he knocked over the whole team, 
No T-Rexes on the beam, on the beam!

Seven T-Rexes trampoline, trampoline
Seven T-Rexes trampoline, trampoline
One fell down, with the others in-between,
No T-Rexes trampoline, trampoline!

Six T-Rexes do the vault, do the vault
Six T-Rexes do the vault, do the vault
One fell down, he tried a somersault,
No T-Rexes do the vault, do the vault!

Five T-Rexes do a roll, do a roll
Five T-Rexes do a roll, do a roll
One fell down, he rolled into a pole,
No T-Rexes do a roll, do a roll!

Four T-Rexes swing on bars, swing on bars
Four T-Rexes swing on bars, swing on bars
One fell down, he flew so very far,
No T-Rexes swing on bars, swing on bars!

Three T-Rexes bounce with balls, bounce with balls
Three T-Rexes bounce with balls, bounce with balls
One fell down, he bounced into the wall,
No T-Rexes bounce with balls, bounce with balls!

Two T-Rexes climb the rope, climb the rope
Two T-Rexes climb the rope, climb the rope
One fell down, it was slippery like soap,
No T-Rexes climb the rope, climb the rope!

One T-Rex is on the rings, on the rings
One T-Rex is on the rings, on the rings
He fell down, oh, look how far he swings, 
No T-Rexes on the rings, on the rings!

Ten T-Rexes stack up high, stack up high
Ten T-Rexes stack up high, stack up high
They fell down, but they gave it one more try
Ten T-Rexes stack up high, stack up high!
Ten T-Rexes reached the sky, reached the sky!

Lyrics:
Five little ducks went swimming one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack, quack, quack!‚Äù
But only four little ducks came back

Four little ducks went swimming one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack, quack, quack!‚Äù
But only three little ducks came back

Three little ducks went swimming one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack, quack, quack!‚Äù
But only two little ducks came back

Two little ducks went swimming one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack, quack, quack!‚Äù
But only one little duck came back

One little duck went swimming one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack, quack, quack!‚Äù
But no little ducks came back

No little ducks went swimming one day
Over the hill and far away
Mother duck said, ‚ÄúQuack, quack, quack!‚Äù
And all the little ducks came back!

But they have trouble it seems
Getting eggy out from the tree
Dinos, why don‚Äôt you see
If there‚Äôs another idea.

Dinos they jump all at once to see
If a quake will shake the tree
Boom! Boom! Boom!
Oopsie! The fruits fell right out the tree
Sticky as fruits can be!
Dinos, they work as a dino team
But they have trouble it seems
Getting eggy out from the tree
Dinos, why don‚Äôt you see
If there‚Äôs another idea.

Dinos they swing like in a trapeze
They think that this is a breeze!
Whoa! Whoa! WHOA!
Hey now! Don‚Äôt let go so quick-a-ly!
Look, now! You just missed the tree!
Dinos, they work as a dino team
But they have trouble it seems
Getting eggy out from the tree
Dinos, why don‚Äôt you see
If there‚Äôs another idea.

Dinos, they stack one on top of each
Stretching, just so they can reach
Poor Eggy!
Whoa there! You think you can reach the top?
Yippee! Be careful, don‚Äôt drop!
Dinos, they finally did succeed
Working as a dino team!
They got Eggy out from the tree
Dinos why don‚Äôt you see
What is inside the last egg!

Dive, dive, in the sky
Twirl, twirl, fly on by,
They‚Äôre learning how to fly-o!

Five little birds are out today
Finding food to eat-o
Worms, worms, taste so sweet
Seeds, seeds, good to eat
Nuts, nuts, what a treat,
They‚Äôre finding food to eat-o!

Five little birds are out today
Building on a nest-o
Twigs, twigs, they‚Äôre the best
Grass, grass, fills the nest
Mud, mud, sticks the rest
They‚Äôre building on a nest-o!

Five little birds are out today
Learning how to sing-o
Tweet, tweet, loud and clear
Chirp, chirp, have no fear
Peep, peep, so all can hear
They‚Äôre learning how to sing-o!

Five little birds are out today
Learning how to dance-o
Hop, hop, up and down
Twist, twist, all around
Stomp, stomp, on the ground
They‚Äôre learning how to dance-o

We found the blue whale
We can see his huge tail
He‚Äôs so big that it gives him away

The seaweed is swaying,
And we‚Äôre down here playing
The whale tries to hide in a cave
He won‚Äôt fit inside
‚ÄòCause his head is too wide
There‚Äôs his tail, we can all see it wave

The seaweed is swaying
And we‚Äôre down here playing
The whale tries to hide in the reef
But hey there, look out,
We can still see his snout
Look, he‚Äôs right there behind that small leaf

The seaweed is swaying
And we‚Äôre down here playing
He hid by the old submarine
He couldn‚Äôt get in,
We can still see his fin
He‚Äôs so sad that we hear sniffling

The seaweed is swaying
And we‚Äôre down here playing
Let‚Äôs all try to find a new game
Blue‚Äôs too big to hide
But he makes a great slide
He is big, but we‚Äôre friends just the same

Let‚Äôs explore the awesome planets,  
We‚Äôll fly in our rocket ship!
Let‚Äôs explore the awesome planets,
We‚Äôll have an exciting trip!

CHORUS:
All eight planets travel in orbit
We‚Äôll get to know them, every one!
Solar system, solar system
Planets spin around the Sun

Mercury is the smallest planet, the
Very first one that we see, it‚Äôs
Really hot with lots of craters,
Just as dry as it can be

Venus is the second planet
Shining brightly in the sky
Having lots of clouds and gases
Makes it hot and bare and dry

Earth is third, it is our home
There‚Äôs oxygen and water here
Everything we need for living
Plus a moon that‚Äôs very near

Mars is fourth, the planet that is
Red with rust all o-ver, we
Wanted to explore this world, so 
We sent up the ro-ver

Jupiter is really big, it‚Äôs
Made of many ga-ses
It has sixty-seven moons, see
Each one as it pa-sses

Saturn is the next big planet, the
One with all the pretty rings
They‚Äôre made up of ice and dust, they‚Äôre
Particles of bigger things

Uranus is the seventh planet,
Mostly made of ice and gas, it‚Äôs
Really cold, and spinning sideways,
Hit by something in the past

Neptune is the final planet, it‚Äôs 
Color is a pretty blue
Having lots of wind and cyclones
Makes it very cold, it‚Äôs true
