Special thanks to Zak and Make-A-Wish! Over the summer, Make-A-Wish contacted me about Zak and it was one of the coolest experiences meeting him. He requested a Scott The Woz episode on Skylanders: Trap Team back in June, but I asked if Toys to Life in general would be okay considering it would be tough to do an episode on its own about just that one game. Zak played Dex Mohs in this episode!
