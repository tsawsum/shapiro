The Roman Empire never rose. In its place is a series of various kingdoms, competing for power for what Europe, will even be.

But on a peninsula far from Europe, a new power still rises to redefine the landscape.

What if the South Won the American Civil War?,2015-04-12T23:16:43Z,PT7M16S,4243687,54809,N/A,AlternateHistoryHub,UClfEht64_NrzHf8Y0slKEjw,"The American Civil War was the most devastating event in United States history. It changed the entire fate of the nation, and created the  America we know today.

But, what if that all changed? What if instead of a Southern defeat, the Confederates won the Civil War? Using alternate history, that is a question I am to theorize about.
