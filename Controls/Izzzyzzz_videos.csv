Since it's initial release in 2010, Monster High has become an absolutely iconic doll line, widely praised for it's bold aesthetic and ahead-of-it's-time ideas- however, it's also gone through it's fair share of drama and controversy, including an abysmal 2016 reboot which essentially tanked the brand. Now in 2022 Monster High has undergone it's second reboot and redesign- and it's fair to say the fan reception has been mixed. Today, let's dive into the world of Monster High Generation 3!

In their own strange way these videos are all incredibly nostalgic, and helped to shape YouTube and even internet horror in general!

DeviantArt has been around for over two decades, and in that time it's experienced roaring success, gaining millions of users, worldwide acclaim, and recognition as one of the most influential and iconic websites on the internet. Internet art as we know it likely wouldn't exist without DeviantArt- so why is the website SO bitterly hated by so many of the artists that used to use it regularly? Why has the site experienced such a huge drop in active users? And why on earth is it tied up in a lawsuit right now?!? Today, let's cover the rise and fall of DeviantArt.

**SORRY there’s an error in the patreon credits where the fanart isn’t attributed correctly! In order the art was made by Dorkymuffins001, P4rtker, and Cipherfoxeswithhats. So sorry for the mixup!! :’D

It's no secret that The Sims 4 has had... a bit of a rocky history.

Well, today let's cover the dramatic story of the Sims 4- from it's deeply troubled development, to it's buggy launch, to the many dramas, controversies, and issues that have surrounded it since it's inception.

Today let's dive into the twisted story of Killswitch. Allegedly released in 1989, the creepy game could only be played once and no copies of it remain, spurring on a desperate and frenzied search for the lost media. Marked by drama, exhaustion and dead-ends, the search would be fruitless- but still, the tale of Killswitch remains. Today let's take a deeper look at the story of a haunted, lost game to figure out what's really going on.

And what's with their new NFT game??? All these questions and more will be covered in today's deep dive.

Breaking Bad: Why Heisenberg Doesn't Exist,2020-08-08T08:41:27Z,PT21M45S,146368,8815,N/A,Izzzyzzz,UCWyRlMktpKbfefqBQk8U6Nw,"**MAJOR SPOILER WARNING seriously if you haven't watched the show don't let me spoil it for you!**

Also my apologies for the low quality footage in some parts! Mostly I tried to use my own footage but had to use uploaded clips in some parts so the quality dipped! Hopefully it's not too distracting, and sorry again!

PHEW this was a beast of a video to make. Skip to the end if you want an explanation as to why this video is so different to my usual content, but tdlr; I'm going to try branching out into video essays/analysis/discussion videos, and topics that I personally enjoy rather than just drama :) Hope you enjoy, this was super fun to make!!
