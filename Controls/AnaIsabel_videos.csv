Join me in taking the “red pill” as I explore the (rising) depths of the online manosphere, “alpha males”, and the supposed icons of this growing community.  

note: I got myself a new mic and am still trying to wrap my head around the audio mixing for it, and unfortunately the audio kinda craps itself somewhere around the later middle section. It gets better in the chapter after though, I promise! 🙏

Bound to the same movies, shows, and even public events… all for companies to exploit their image as an “ideal” romantic couple? 

Let’s dive into the wild world of “Love Teams”, a phenomenon unique to the entertainment industry of the Philippines that make Hollywood “ships” look like child’s play. I explore the dark side of this national trend behind its often pure, wholesome façade: particularly the loyal fans that fight to keep these “couples” together forever. ❤️‍🩹

Join me as I dive into the conspiracy theory that’s captured a generation, and its underlying message in the wild west era of internet misinformation. 

""We needed a way to keep an eye on the American citizens without them knowing. It was imperative, for their own safety of course. We hired only the best. It took years. We designed, built, tested, failed. We persisted. Eventually, over decades, we had it. A fleet of covert technological surveillance devices unlike anything the world had ever seen. We called them, 'Birds'."" - Richard Nixon, 1978 (from birdsarentreal.com)
