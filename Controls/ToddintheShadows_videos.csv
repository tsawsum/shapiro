Perpetually updated version here: https://nebula.tv/videos/todd-in-the-shadows-songs-that-stop-on-the-word-stop-supercut-deluxe

Ground rules: If there was even the briefest of stops, I counted it. It's okay if the band holds the note rather than complete silence. But the entire band has to stop, not just a couple instruments; the singer can keep singing though.

This was compiled through months of research and extensive crowdsourcing. If you ever left a comment suggesting a song and it wound up in this video, it was probably your suggestion that did it.
