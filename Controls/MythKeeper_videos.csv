We return to the Impossible Lands to take a look at Geb and Nex's small but influential neighbor - Alkenstar.

This video also includes details about Alkenstar's close ally, Dongun Hold and the nearby deadly region known as the Mana Wastes that serve as a no-mans-land between Nex and Geb.

Because this is my third video in this region I suggest starting with the other two which go a little bit deeper in some of the history of the region and which you can find here:

This is probably the longest video I will ever make on this channel, because I'm tackling not just 1 but 3 different countries - Mendev, Brevoy and Iobaria. Why did I decide to combine these all into one video? Well, you'll see, but there's a lot of shared history and heritage between these nations. For those hungry for more, the crusades of Mendev will also get a little more shape in an upcoming Sarkoris/Worldwoun deep dive and there's also a little detail about Brevoy that's covered in my River Kingdoms deep dive that's been on the channel for some time.

In any case, enjoy this immense feature-length video on the history, current events and important locations of the Iobarian nations.

Also, credit where credit is due, many thanks to Reddit user Hyperonn ( https://www.reddit.com/user/Hyperonn/ ) for providing the combined Mendev/Brevoy/Iobaria map that I'm using in this video. The map of New Stetven is not an official map, but one developed by user Narolas from the Cartographer's Guild.

We're going back to Garund today to take a look at the first country in a whole new region - the Impossible Lands.

This video is richer in details in terms of the culture and societal norms of Geb, because of how unique this country is, but a little lighter in terms of the important locations - this will likely be a consistent trend across the impossible lands. Hopefully I've captured the most relevant things here as you go and play your Geb or Geb-adjacent adventures.

We're headed back north today to take a deep look at the Realm of the Mammoth Lords. This was a fairly difficult one to put together as Paizo hasn't got all the information catalogued in one source. I had to go back to early Pathfinder Chronicles Settings books and a few other sources to really fill this one out, including use of the 2nd Edition Quest for the Frozen Flame adventure path's supplemental content. The Mythic Realms book also includes a bunch of interesting details around the Tusk Mountains, so that also became a valuable resource. Hope you find this one worth your time.

The history section on this one is a little different - its not a history of the nation but a history of the Kellids instead. Much of this is well worn ground, but taken with a slightly different perspective. No one will judge you if you jump ahead using the chapter titles. ;-)

This week, following on from last week's Creature Feature: Giants video ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYgDzqNkXq4 ), I'm tackling the Giant Pantheon. The giants of Pathfinder worshop many gods, some of which I cover here but many of which I have tackled in previous videos.

These are fairly obscure deities, and though some of these got a little more mention in the Giantslayer AP, which I drew on where appropriate, many are lacking in some key details including their holy symbols, which are described but often not provided. Where official holy symbols could not be found, I have provided my own based on the descriptions provided.
