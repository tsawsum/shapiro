Might as well pop a little FYI in the description! Hello :D Thanks for making the last video bang as righteously as it did. I'm gonna be getting to work on my next big project after this: a retrospective on Tarkir (both the block & the world). I can't say it'll be the next video I put out, but it's certainly the project that I'll be focusing my efforts on producing in terms of research! 
The last few videos I've put out have all had some kind of hard deadline attached to them, be them sponsorships, trying to stay ahead of Magic's release schedule like this one, or just ""holy heck it's been three months already?!"" kinda moments & as a result I've kinda been jumping from one to the other without much time to do the accessibility stuff I really want to do i.e. captioning! I'll be sorting that all out for the last few videos (silver border to this one) over the next month or so.
I also realise I haven't streamed since [i don't want to check] so i'll be getting back to that some time very soon.
That's all from me, for now. Stay spicy, you lovely reader of the description, you!

Hello all! Been a hectic few weeks, but things are coming together (thanks to your support) and I'm so excited to see what this year brings! To get a wee sneak preview, head over to my patreon and see what goals we passed (hint: before the Moneey video, I had yet to hit the Lorwyn/Tarkir goal!). My next few videos are planned, if not in production, and I have some fun ideas of how I'm gonna change up the patreon in the coming year as well. Blessed day to you all, Spice x
