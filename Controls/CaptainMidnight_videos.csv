Disney Plus's new Book of Boba Fett wrapped up its first season this week, with very mixed results. In this video I go into why this Star Wars show doesn't work for me. From the boring characters, to the show being completely taken over by the cast of The Mandalorian. At least it was nice to see Grogu.

Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland was a massive hit back in 2010. It proved to be a huge hit for Disney and kicked off their era of live-action remakes. This movie...has a lot to answer for.

The Marvel Cinematic Universe is back on the big screen, but its issues remain the same. There is a lot to like in this movie, thanks to great actors like Florence Pugh, David Harbour and of course, Scarlett Johansson, but it is completely letdown by the MCU's obsession with big third act battles made by a team of effects artists.

J.J. Abrams' Star Trek came out in 2009 and kicked off a new era for Kirk, Spock and the gang. Gone were the long conversations about ethics and morality, it was time to see Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto in a full on action movie.

Cruella (2021) is Disney's latest attempt to revitalize an old brand: 101 Dalmatians. Emma Stone and Emma Thompson do their best, and give engaging performances in the movie, but ultimately the film is dragged down by having to be a prequel at all. Here is why.

National Treasure was a big hit for Disney back in 2004, then its sequel, Book of Secrets, made even more money. So it's a little odd that Nicolas Cage's Ben Gates and his Declaration of Independence stealing friends weren't brought back for more. In this video, I try to get to the bottom of why Disney's other franchises get new entries constantly, while National Treasure languishes.

The first two episodes of WandaVision kick things off to a promising start for the Marvel Disney Plus shows. Wanda (Elizabeth Olson) and Vision (Paul Bettany) are living the simple life in a sitcom world inspired by shows like Bewitched. It soon becomes clear though that there's something sinister going on in the MCU.

Spider-Man: Miles Morales just isn't the PlayStation game I was hoping for.

Christopher Nolan has become one of the most successful film directors of the 21st century, with films like Batman Begins, Tenet, The Dark Knight and Inception. In this video I take a long look at Nolan's career both in and outside of DC, and why I think his work has been misunderstood.

Sure, The Mandalorian was a hit, but overall the Disney Plus experience has not improved. In this video I go over the behind the scenes drama with Obi-Wan, Lizzie McGuire and Hulu. It feels like Disney doesn't have a handle on what they want the streaming service to be.
