For game details (and text in the bottom left):
- Text should refer to the version of a game being mentioned in the video. If the version shown isn't obvious it should be indicated in brackets but usually what's shown should correlate to what I'm saying (the arcade version is used in arcade sections, console is console sections etc.). 
- The date refers to the first release (often Japanese) of that version of the game. For console games this means the console release, not any earlier arcade release date.
- The name of the developer is used rather than publisher, but in-house first party studios are usually shortened/simplified. For example Nintendo R&D1 is listed as just Nintendo, Square Enix Business Division 2 would be listed as Square Enix. Etc.
- Footage from remasters and remakes was (mostly) avoided but lots of what's shown is original games emulated at a higher resolution than the original console. This makes some games look better than they really were, but older games also benefited greatly from being shown on CRT displays so I think this sort of balances out. Regardless, I tried to strike a balance between authenticity and visual quality but don't take what you see as absolute gospel.
- I'm sure there are typos somewhere but it is what it is. Typos aren't so bad, they just remind you this was made by a human. A rather tired human.

It was just a one time purchase made after playing the game for a couple months, at a time when I had no idea I'd end up making a video about the game.

This video ended up slightly different to how I intended. I had a huge amount to say about this game and, despite this videos long length, I ended up cutting a huge amount of the notes I‚Äôd made and also had to be very selective with what to include. In the end I focused on what seemed most important to me: the game‚Äôs biggest flaws and its most underappreciated strengths. The end result is that I spend roughly an equal amount of time in this video criticizing the witcher 3 as I do praising it, but it‚Äôs not because I dislike the game as much as I like it. I love the witcher 3, and I hope that even if this video is heavy with criticism that it still feels like a celebration of this game, because it was very much intended to be.","The Witcher 3,witcher 3,the witcher 3,the witcher 3 review,the witcher 3 critique,the witcher 3 analysis,the witcher 3 retrospective,critique,retrospective,witcher game review,witcher 3 game review,the witcher 3 why,overrated,neverknowsbest,best rpg,greatest rpg,witcher 3 sucks,witcher critique,witcher 3 critique,witcher 3 analysis,witcher 3 review,the witcher 3 gameplay,witcher 3 masterpiece",20,1595,0
