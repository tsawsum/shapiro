Some More News' Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSNWkRw53Jo

Footnote One, on the subject of universal healthcare:

A patron had this point to make, so I thought I'd address it here. They said, paraphrased, ""Actually Peterson is from Canada and supports their healthcare system. Doesn't that challenge your point on his conservatism""

The answer? Not really. While Peterson is broadly a conservative, of course I recognise that universal healthcare is the status quo position in most places where it exists and that he supports it. My point here was not about particular policies he doesn't support, but about the incoherence of his claim that ""shovelling money down the hierarchy"" is so profoundly difficult because people are too stupid. To make that point, he has to disregard obvious solutions to this problem. 

Footnote Two, on the subject of Race and IQ:

I assume some fans of Peterson will think I am straw-manning him or taking him out of context on this point. I am not. It is impossible to watch this video and think he doesn't believe certain races, including black people, are genetically different with regard to IQ: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02w5E7FGlY&t=565s. And he has, on multiple occasions, lent support to the Bell Curve. I don't think my claim here is controversial at all, to be honest. Here is Shaun's incredible video on the Bell Curve, if you're interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBc7qBS1Ujo&t=103s

Answering a possible question: Why didn't you talk about the last tweet more? Doesn't it seem like that person is pro bestiality? I didn't talk about it because I'd just be repeating myself. It's wildly to uncharitable to think that that tweet is saying ""you need an argument for why bestiality is bad"" and not ""you need an argument that differentiates animal sex from animal eating beyond 'one of those is gross'"" But I already made this point so I wanted to move on. 

Shoe0nhead on fat-phobia (this video is unlisted so I guess she must feel some kind of way about it. I just used my memory of shoe's content to write this part of the video. May have not used this had I known she unlisted it, but I still think it stands since it doesn't seem like she's said anything about it lol.): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfh0WifoTVQ&t=1s

One Art
BY ELIZABETH BISHOP
The art of losing isn’t hard to master;
so many things seem filled with the intent
to be lost that their loss is no disaster.

Lose something every day. Accept the fluster
of lost door keys, the hour badly spent.
The art of losing isn’t hard to master.

Then practice losing farther, losing faster:
places, and names, and where it was you meant
to travel. None of these will bring disaster.

I lost my mother’s watch. And look! my last, or
next-to-last, of three loved houses went.
The art of losing isn’t hard to master.

I lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster,
some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.
I miss them, but it wasn’t a disaster.

—Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture
I love) I shan’t have lied. It’s evident
the art of losing’s not too hard to master
though it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.","the art of losing,elizabeth bishop,one art,poetry,big joel,analysis,interpretation",1,1306,0

Article on abortion in Texas: https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/7kz9wz/what-its-like-to-get-an-abortion-in-texas

Footnote 1: I just wanted to add a footnote here to clarify: I’m not trying to imply here that all chemical abortions go off without a hitch. A friend talked to me about it and had a bad experience, so if you had one of those, I’m not here to tell you that it’s an easy or fun thing in all cases. The amount of pain and bleeding it causes seems to vary a lot. I’m just saying, Planned Parenthood doesn’t lie about the side effects of their medication or treat the suffering of its clients as unimportant. At least, I’ve found no evidence to suggest that is the case. 

Footnote 2: So, I’m well aware that both these guys probably know full well that the argument they’re making *won’t* convince pro lifers. Cody no doubt doesn’t actually think he’s going to get Ben Shapiro, and an extremely important point in Ian’s videos is that this argument would NEVER convince pro lifers, because conservatives are broadly more concerned with punishing evil than actually doing something about the problem. But here, I want to make a distinction. A distinction between an argument that is likely to persuade people and an intellectually persuasive argument. We all intuitively understand that this is a meaningful distinction, right. We know that there’s no way to convince a flat earther that the earth is round, but we also know that the arguments we can provide for the roundness of the earth are very good. That if the flat earther was thinking rationally and cared about the evidence, he would accept that he was wrong. The problem I have with these arguments is not that they wouldn’t actually persuade real pro lifers. I know that I probably haven’t done that myself. Rather, my problem is that they aren’t intellectually persuasive. They accept the terms of pro lifers insofar as that they assume, for the sake of argument, that abortion is something people might rationally want to reduce. But they ignore the actual problem pro lifers have with them, that they think, on some level at least, that fetuses are people and that ending their lives is murder. If you really accept that, then your argument to ban abortion is as simple as the words “I believe murder should be socially prohibited, outlawed in some way.” And that’s just not a particularly hard claim to defend. Most people would agree with it. In other words, pro lifers don’t think abortions are like driving your car too fast or shoplifting, they think it’s a very important problem. And so, saying “well if we did this social thing, we’d at least reduce them somewhat.” it’s just not a good enough case. It’s not just that it wouldn’t persuade pro lifers, it’s that it shouldn’t persuade them because it’s not persuasive. It’s for this reason, by the way, that I make the case here that our argument for abortion needs to be as simple as “abortions are fine. They’re not a Big Moral Problem that needs solving. The core assumption of the pro life argument is wrong.”","unplanned,gods not dead,big joel,pureflix,abortion,propaganda,pro life,pro choice,anti abortion,video essay",1,16274,0

Footnote on architecture: So, I want to be a bit specific here. I’m not claiming that modernism had NO impact on architecture, that would be silly. But this video makes a far more ambitious point: That modernism’s effect on architecture was SPECIFICALLY that it inspired architects to build less expensive and aesthetically appealing buildings. And I’m totally unsure of why we’d think that. These capitalists weren’t planning on building small, stone or wood buildings in the first place, that was never their plan. They were going to build large skyscrapers and factories, whether the modernists liked it or not. And sure, aesthetic concerns were relevant, but are we really claiming that the budget for these buildings would have been way higher had modernism never become a movement? If people hadn't ""decided"" that art was subjective? Seems unbelievably ridiculous to me, and I’d like to see at least SOME proof of it. I have looked into it for this video and found nothing, but feel free to send me sources showing that I’m wrong here. The weirdest example of this in the video, that I didn't call out specifically, is that theorists saying taste is subjective produced conditions under which NOBODY was ALLOWED to call buildings ugly anymore, giving capitalists a free pass. Like, that's not how history works. Another problem here, that I didn't get into enough in the video, is that there's a constant conflation  of ""buildings that were made mostly to serve a purpose"" and ""elegantly designed modernist buildings that were trying to accomplish a pleasing aesthetic goal and did so well"" But like, the Guggenheim was also ""inspired by modernism"" as were many buildings that were obviously extremely ambitious and attractive to many people. Of course, that conflation is useful to school of life (which simply wants us to reject modernism and embrace tradition, architecturally speaking) but it leads to a problem where, literally all modern buildings can be understood only as a capitalist trick, using modernism as a cudgel. If I ever make a sequel video, I'll clarify this stuff more.

Footnote: So, in the video, I say that we can’t know if God suffers or not for sure, and that seems true. Were I religious, I wouldn’t feel like I had absolute knowledge of the nature of God, and that’s certainly the prevailing belief of most religious people, particularly Jews. That said, writing this video, I imagined I’d get two responses that I do want to talk about here. First, “You say that God doesn’t seem like he suffers, but perhaps he suffers when people suffer, feels the pain people do.” Second, “I’m a Christian and I certainly believe that God suffers. He took the form of Christ and suffered and died for our sins.”
The reason I put both these potential comments together is that my response to them is the same. In these situations, God NEEDS humans in order to suffer. Either because the pain of human existence brings God pain, or because God took a human form in order to suffer. Thus, suffering is still known uniquely to humans, an experience God may not innately have. In fact, I would say this response only strengthens the argument of this video. Perhaps people are uniquely able to experience morality because they suffer, and God requires the assumption of human suffering in order to have that sense. Interesting stuff.","adam and eve,god,genisis,big joel,religion,atheism,judaism,christianity,analysis,video essay",1,6844,0

Footnote: So, broadly speaking, historians just don’t really talk like this, give credits or attaboys to various historical moments. They don’t pretend that eras of human history exist in isolation, uninfluenced by anything else, and if you said in a historical setting “no progress occured before the enlightenment,” you’d have a bunch of medievalists on your ass saying “fuck off.” So I have no clue where Hazony’s getting this idea. Even the example he uses here, Steven Pinker’s quote, feels extremely threadbare. Steven Pinker isn’t a historian, he’s a linguist and pop academic, and his claim here isn’t really a historical one. There is no sense in Pinker’s work that he cares about establishing an argument about the enlightenment era, proving that it was the first time a set of ideas were had. No, he’s talking about the ideology the enlightenment is known for, empiricism, democracy, limits on government, secular reasoning, etc. His book is about how great liberalism is, not about how John Locke was super original and stuff. So, yeah, without any kind of evidence for Hazony’s ridiculous claim, I have to assume it’s not true. Since that’s how claims work lol.","prageru,big joel,prageru enlightenment,yoram hazoney,fever dream of prageru,tradition,morals,prageru series",1,4636,0

Patricia Taxxon was nice enough to let me use her music. I took songs from the Albums Telecommunications, Traveller, Nostalgia, Gallery, and Paul. You can find them here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOjLfFE0TABS9bk05oH-kgw

To watch the bit of animation by Lilly Ashton that didn't make its way into final video, go here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Odggf2SoGK4

Two places where I used poetic license. 
1) The final short in the Rip Van Winkle series was released a few years after 1896. 
2) In the scene with an Aang poster in the film, it's actually not a wanted poster, she's putting it up to signal to the world that the avatar has returned. Still, the scene visually evokes The Deserter

Notes on the episodes of Avatar  name dropped:
Jet: The Gaang encounters a radical who believes that liberation is worth any price and who is willing to act immorally in order to reach his goals. His belief is challenged by the notion that revolution must always be moral.
The Northern Air Temple: Aang must come to terms with the fact that his traditional world is gone. He has to accept that progress happens and that it can be good even when it hurts his sense of self and history.
The Fortune Teller: A town has been so indoctrinated into believing the words of a mystic, and they have staked their egos so thoroughly on their trust for her, that they aren’t willing to do what’s necessary to save their own lives.
The Waterbending Master: Pakku, a waterbending master, refuses to teach Katara because she’s a woman. He realizes, in the end, that his dogmatism and rigidness came at the cost of his fiance.","the last airbender,avatar,the last airbender analysis,m night shyamalan the last airbender,m night shyamalan avatar,the last airbender review,avatar the last airbender,avatar the last airbender adaptation,m night shyamalan,the last airbender movie,avatar movie,big joel,last airbender review,analysis,video essay,the last airbender video essay,last airbender big joel",1,1146,0

Death Note: How a Story Plays a Game | Big Joel,2017-09-08T18:51:18Z,PT8M27S,78131,4107,N/A,Big Joel,UCaN8DZdc8EHo5y1LsQWMiig,"In this video, I talk about the original Death Note anime and a comparison to the 2017 Netflix Death Note Movie. I argue that the most important difference between the two is a feeling of game play that is so important in the show and nonexistent in the film. If you're wondering what I think about the movie, I'll just tell you now: I think it's bad, and partly, this essay is an analysis of why I think it's bad. Spoilers for both things ensue.
