*Kimmel's book was purchased before the sexual harassment accusations against him were made; the book is good but I do not endorse the writer.

For further reading on the conservative upsurge in transphobia after the legalization of gay marriage, try the essay ""My Vagina is Haunted"" in the book Neoreaction a Basilisk by Elizabeth Sandifer.

The observation that whiteness is a social construct invented to justify white supremacy can be further researched in the works of Ibram X. Kendi; his major text on race is Stamped from the Beginning. (I confess, I know Kendi's arguments from podcasts and various other people citing him; Stamped from the Beginning is on my reading list but I haven't gotten to it yet. He's by no means the only person pointing out how whiteness works, but he's famous for being the best.)","alt-right playbook,video essay,innuendo studios,ian danskin,alt-right,conservatism,fascism,authoritarianism,racism,politics,nazis,nazism,totalitarianism,propaganda",24,9489,0

SEMIOTICS

A good place to start is Folding Ideas' (really old) video on signs and memes: https://youtu.be/rs0sybzUu24

Here's a whole site on it when you wanna go more in depth: http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/S4B/

DEATH OF THE AUTHOR

I'd say the best place to start would be the essay ""Greatly Exaggerated"" by David Foster Wallace, but it's, sadly, not online. It's in this book: https://www.amazon.com/Supposedly-Fun-Thing-Never-Again/dp/0316925284

Here's a rundown of the essay: http://machines.plannedobsolescence.net/dfwwiki/index.php?title=Greatly_Exaggerated

Here's Roland Barthes original essay that coined the phrase: http://www.tbook.constantvzw.org/wp-content/death_authorbarthes.pdf

And here's Michel Foucault's expansion of the theory: http://www.movementresearch.org/classesworkshops/melt/Foucault_WhatIsAnAuthor.pdf

ENUNCIATION THEORY

The best way to acquaint yourself with enunciation theory is to read through the glossary of Casetti's Inside the Gaze: https://www.amazon.com/Inside-Gaze-Fiction-Spectator-Translation/dp/0253334438

...but here's an article on it: https://francescocasetti.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/filmtheoryandenunciation.pdf

Why Are You So Angry?

NOTE: if you are interested and financially capable of doing MORE than talking, I recommend picking up a copy of Civility in the Digital Age (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0789750244/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0789750244&linkCode=as2&tag=civilination-20). It's a valuable resource for improving online communities, and all proceeds go to CiviliNation, a non-profit resource for dealing with and preventing online harassment.
