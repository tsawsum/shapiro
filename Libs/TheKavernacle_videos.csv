YouTubers Need to STOP Promoting BetterHelp,2024-02-24T04:00:23Z,PT29M49S,60243,4454,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Better Help has been a constant presence as a sponsor for some of the biggest YouTubers. Despite multiple high profile controversies, some of your favourite good guy YouTubers just can't help themselves taking that sweet Better Help paycheck. 

This video was made to serve as a reference point for anyone who asks 'but why is Better Help bad?' From patient horror stories, therapists being overworked and underpaid, lack of a proper vetting process for new therapists, links to the IDF and just a general poor user experience - this isn't a company that YouTubers should be forcing on their audiences (who they wouldn't be famous without).

We Need to Talk about Taylor Swift's Politics and Corporate Liberal Feminism,2024-02-20T03:40:00Z,PT1H6M22S,59730,3289,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Taylor Swift has become (maybe) the most popular musician of all time, and has caused a hysterical reaction across the American Political spectrum. To Conservatives, she is a psy-op that's sole purpose is to get Joe Biden re-elected, to white millennial liberals she is a girl boss billionaire who represents everything that right with Liberal Feminism. 

But for me - I don't get it...? I mean I do get it but I feel that its not because her music is *THAT GOOD* so why is she so popular across the world? 

Well that is what we are going to talk about in this video. In my humble leftist opinion, Taylor Swift's popularity is due to globalist capitalist homogenisation - she is the music version of an MCU movie. Designed to appeal to everyone, music that is designed to be inoffensive to gain mass consumption - and this is helped by the global music 'press' which is essentially corporate PR for artists.

https://youtu.be/Pc6nVVippMY


YouTube Sponsorships - we all love them. Us the creators love the money, you the viewer love supporting your fav creator and sitting through an ad for a water bottle flavour thing you'd never buy. Many YouTubers rely on sponsors for their income, especially those who upload more infrequently. 

There is no ethical consumption under capitalism but does that mean its all fair game? Many YouTubers have long term sponsorships with objectively terrible companies. For someone like me its impossible to dissociate HelloFresh from Kurtis Conner, or BetterHelo from Easy Allies. They essentially become company mascots perhaps unintentionally. When a company is explicitly bad, I don't think its too much to ask that they don't advertise for these companies.

The Dystopian CULT of Looks MAXXING (Men are not okay),2024-01-22T03:30:10Z,PT19M32S,72965,2809,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"In 2024, as men we are constantly bombarded with fitness influencers and celebrities promoting their simple workout regimes that will definitely make us all look like Chris Hemsworth if we diet and exercise like them! These ads usually prey on our own male insecurity to look both MASSIVE.tm and LEAN at the same time while not spending thousands on expensive 'products' to make this more accessible. 

Now men are looking for cheats to look better. This can be as harmless as telling men to shave, workout and diet to doing stuff like 'mewing' or 'bonesmashing' - which is as weird as it sounds

In recent weeks, we have been covering the IDF's social media propaganda on TikTok. But don't worry there are plenty of more absurd videos they have produced on their YouTube channel - which we are going to look at today. 


.00:00:00 - This propaganda is so bad 
00:04:20 - They can't stop using women in these videos 
00:08:00 - Protect your mental health!!!
00:11:00 - The Dancing Solider

Ben Shapiro's TERRIBLE Star Wars Takes (He LOVES Rise of Skywalker!),2023-12-16T05:07:00Z,PT28M53S,16928,1033,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"My Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/join/TheKavernacle

We all have our favourite Star Wars movies, although its safe to say Disney's Sequel Trilogy is the least popular of all of them. However, despite the leftist message of the prequels and OT, Star Wars has many many conservative fans - and yes you guess it - they have terrible opinions on what movies are bad and which are good. Ben Shapiro, the failed Hollywood screenwriter, loves the abomination that was the Rise of Skywalker... which pretty much says it all. 



.00:00:00 - Ben and Conservative Star Wars Fans 
00:05:40 - The Sequel Trilogy was a MISTAKE 
00:10:40 - Ben Shapiro Ranks the Star Wars Films 
00:16:00 - Ben Shapiro just wants Nostalgia bait 
00:21:00 - Ben Shapiro loves Rise of Skywalker 
00:25:45 - The Sequels were just so bad

Bernie Sanders BETRAYED The Left by Supporting Israel,2023-12-14T05:00:26Z,PT30M51S,24489,1489,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Bernie Sanders presidential runs in 2016 and 2020 were inspirational moments for many in Western politics which helped galvanise the Lib-Left in US politics - culminating with the rise of the squad. Bernie has been seen as the modern father of US political Leftism in electoral politics and has been one of the rare prominent voices to offer vocal criticism of Netayahu. 

However, in recent months Bernie has refused to support a ceasefire until today, and it has left many in progressive circles shocked and dismayed believing Bernie had suddenly done a 180 on his positions. 

But Bernie hasn't. He has always supported Israel and comes from a tradition of early 1960s Leftism that both support Israel and saw it as a model for potential socialist reform in the US.

Hollywood has LOST ITS MIND Over Israel-Palestine (The New RED SCARE),2023-11-25T04:00:15Z,PT25M21S,50309,2984,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"The 1940's and 1950s saw Hollywood, and American society as a whole, completely consumed by paranoia as the Red Scare swept across the Western world. The House of Un-American Activities Committee in the 1940s, and Senator Joseph McCarthy spearheaded investigations into Government and Entertainment to root out suspected Communists who they believed were working as spies for the USSR. This resulted in actual Hollywood screenwriters being sentenced to prison for refusing to testify against their fellow workers or tell the Committee about other socialists in Hollywood. This has been immortalised in films like Good Night, Good Luck and Trumbo - and 2023's Oppenheimer also showed this McCarthyite Red Scare in full effect. 

Hollywood has always been a propaganda outlet for the US military, but more recently has collaborated more with the IDF. Organisations like the ADL have put pressure on studios to censor and fire those who would speak up for the Palestinians and has recently seen high profile firings of actors who support Palestinian humanity. It has essentially become a new Hollywood 'Red Scare', with actors staying silent out of fear of losing their income. On the other hand, Pro-Israeli actors like Amy Schumer have faced zero consequences for their gross social media posts supporting Israel's actions.

Well apparently that has offended a certain Subreddit that haven't got a lot of love for me. The Destiny subreddit proceeded to call me a 'Tankie', 'Neckbeard' and worst of all 'Rizzless'..

I respond to the criticism and talk about weird fans of Twitch streamers.

Recently, he has for some unknown reason focused his attention on sub-Saharan African countries like Kenya, Cameroon and Zimbabwe, or as he likes to call them 'Africa'. 

The videos show Mr Beast helping out rural communities in this country. But if you think it seems like you're watching something from Comic Relief in 2005 you'd be right. Mr Beast has faced criticism in Kenya for his actions, and the western leftist community since these charity videos provide no context as to why these countries need his help in the first place.

Why SO MANY Rich People Say They are Working Class (Victoria Beckham/Elon Musk),2023-10-13T06:48:00Z,PT26M5S,33167,1889,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"The wealthy elite among us like to act as though they have only become successful through hard work alone. To service that myth even further, many like to pretend they were working class, or lower middle class. This reflects an inherent contradiction within neoliberalism, in that being from a working class background and climbing the class ladder is good, but actually being working class is a bad thing.

Recently, Victoria Beckham claimed she had grown up working class only for her husband David to point out that no, she actually grew up pretty well off thanks to her father's business. But wealthy people lie because they feel to admit they had a head start in life diminishes their accomplishments.

The uncomfortable TRUTH about Israel-Palestine and the INSANE Western Hypocrisy on Gaza,2023-10-11T05:30:08Z,PT32M29S,70297,5604,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"A coordinated planned attack led by Hamas saw the Palestine insurgent group break down many of the walls surrounding Gaza and proceeded to attack Israeli settlements and towns sparking a large scale war. This follows recent turmoil in Israel after Netanyahu tried to change the way the government has run. 

The mask has truly dropped in the West, as Israel declares its intent to flatten Gaza - Liberals, Leftist and Conservatives a like have pledge support to the IDF's disgusting campaign. Most comfort themselves that Hamas are so bad and must be stopped whatever the cost.

Elon Musk has finally KILLED TWITTER (1 Year after buying it),2023-10-07T06:30:05Z,PT24M28S,118098,5529,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Elon Musk has had a global reputation as an unconventional but successful businessman over the last two decades. However, a year after purchasing Twitter and running it into the ground, he has pretty much shown everyone his other success was due to him either letting far more competent people running his companies or he just bought his way into things that he didn't create. 

Twitter finds itself in about $13 billion of debt, has a valuation of about $8 billion (probably lower), and has recently announced a whole slew of changes that will make the site even worse. Whether that is promoted tweets not showing they are ads, new ads that look like regular tweets, or the headlines being removed from shared articles, it seems Twitter is not longed for the social media world.

Why Cyberpunk Can't Stop its Anti-Asian Racism Problem (The Creator and Orientalism),2023-10-04T06:35:00Z,PT34M18S,21768,1325,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Cyberpunk was born at a time in America where there was rising fears of a Japanese economic takeover of the world. This and general anti-Asian sentiment in the West is a fundamental part of the building blocks of the Cyberpunk genre. Neuromance, Blade Runner and the Cyberpunk tabletop are part of the foundation and all exhibit these qualities to different degrees. 

While there has been much in the genre to address this or at least divulge away from these tropes (Blade Runner 2049 swaps the East Asian aesthetic for Eastern Europe) the genre still can't get away from it - and the worst example in a while has to be Gareth Edwards' latest film 'The Creator'. 

Set in a war between the USA and New Asia (which might as well be called The Orient), the film shows the very worst of Cyberpunk generations and dehumanisation of Asian peoples that feature so heavily in the genre.

Ben Shapiro and Conservatives DEFENCE of Russell Brand PROVE they NEVER Cared about GROOMERS,2023-09-20T05:46:00Z,PT33M30S,48055,2874,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"In a massive investigation, The Times, The Sunday Times and Channel 4 recently broke a story that outlined historic abuse allegations against Russell Brand going back to 2006. The story provides a lot of testimony, text evidence among other things. Due to Britain's insanely strict libel laws, it seems this story has been gone over extensively by lawyers meaning Russell Brand is unlikely to sue - because the allegations have credibility. 

Conservatives have been on a war path against what they see as 'grooming' - which is usually just bigotry against the LGBT community. However, these same conservatives don't seem too concerned one of Brands victims was 16, in fact they are actually defending him - saying what he did was legal or saying he is a victim of the deep state.

Oh they also get up on stage with Paramore while voting to fund Israel so that makes it cool!

It seems the world is just getting more and more stupid with every grift being even dumber than the last. In the pro-patriarchy world of Conservatives, nothing is more masculine than eating a lot of red meat. But what if we took that even further? What if we literally advocate for a diet that is just red meat, salt and water? 

Well this is what the Peterson’s are advocating for. Saying it has cured them of all ailments, they promote the diet like the snake oil salesmen of the Old West, promising essentially a cure to every single sickness. 

Depressingly, this isn’t the only all meat diet grift going around. There is also ‘Back to Tradition’ masculinity accounts that are also promoting this kind of diet, with celebrity endorsements from Joe Rogan and Bear Grylls among others. 

These diets are obviously terrible for you in the long term.

You’d assume getting arrested would be seen as a negative to a Presidential campaign, and it objectively is because you need to persuade undecided voters to vote for you. But in Conservative Land, getting arrested is actually a good thing for a Presidential campaign…

Due to his unhinged Twitter profile, he was asked to go for social media training by an organisation of Canadians psychologists which he has been a member of since 1999.

Conservatives Say they LOVE These Games for their 'Anti-WOKE' Politics,2023-08-07T03:00:20Z,PT35M22S,50334,2445,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Conservative gamers famously hate politics in video games. But when the politics of a video game agree with them then they don't seem to have much of an issue. However, they also have terrible media analysis skills, so they often claim obviously leftist video games as conservative. 

The Witcher 3 is maybe understandable due to its medieval fantasy setting, however it's hard to even begin understanding how conservatives think Cyberpunk and Metal Gear Solid are non-woke.

Nearly as old as YouTube itself, these usually involved a creator filming themselves watching another channels videos and reacting to it. This usually took the form of them... watching in silence. 

It seems these days most Twitch streamers feel entitled to YouTubers content to pad out their overly long Twitch streams. This is problematic in itself, but as now taken another gross turn as these Twitch streamers clip their low effort reactions and upload to a separate YouTube channel which directly competes and undermines the views of the original creator. 

They also don't seem to understand how this is stealing content and most creators aren't exactly comfortable with this dynamic

However, Nolan’s recent film Oppenheimer depicts many Communists in a pretty good light. Some would say that showing Communists as smart and moral would be ‘woke’... But Ben Shapiro doesn’t think so… 

So according to Conservatives having LGBT or minority representation in films is woke but showing communists in a more positive light isn’t…

Donald Trump banned migration from many Muslim countries and they were constantly a source of his fear mongering. However, last month a Muslim dominated City council in Michigan banned the Pride Flag on government buildings. 

Conservatives now feel like they have a new ally: Muslims. A group who only had 17% support for the GOP in 2018, this rose to 28% by 2022. In the anti-woke fight, conservatives want all the allies they can get.

INSANE Conservative Backlash to Barbie Movie for being 'COMMUNIST',2023-07-19T06:17:00Z,PT32M3S,48695,2210,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"'Barbie' starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is set to be a box office success. Early reviews have been positive and it is set to out perform Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer. You'd think out of the two movies one would be more controversial than the other. 

But it wouldn't be a movie release starring a woman without some anti-woke backlash. US conservatives are crying that Barbie is woke and promoted Communism, while Vietnam had actually banned the film for allegedly showing a map that shows China owning contested Island in the South China Sea.

'GET WOKE GO BROKE' is one of the Biggest Conservative LIES,2023-07-05T06:15:00Z,PT26M43S,43261,2341,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Bud Light, Disney, Nike, United Airlines, Ben and Jerry's - all went woke - but did they go broke? 

This popular saying among the right would have you believe that this is the case, however it appears that companies go woke based on societal and market trends and despite a large backlash - it appears going woke makes you more money. 

.00:00:00 - Get Woke Go Broke is a myth

After the submarine went missing, it was revealed that CEO Stockton Rush had said he didn't want to hire older white Navy veterans for his company but instead wanted younger people. But at the same time, most people in his company are older white dudes. 

Conservatives pounced, saying the disaster was caused by diversity hired and wokeness, despite the fact the sub was piloted by two white guys over 60 (lol)

DEBUNKING The Daily Wire and Conservatives saying The Crusades were a GOOD THING,2023-06-22T03:00:02Z,PT34M4S,34561,1753,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"The First Crusade has long been mythicised as the moment Western Christendom said 'NO MORE!' as Muslim armies invaded Christian territory. Its depicted as a heroic defence that secured the Christian world for the next 900 years. However, this is far from reality. Most Muslim empires were too busy fighting eachother to even care about the Christian religion, even in Spain, the Caliphate of Cordoba was swept up in civil war - while in the Middle East the Seljuk Turks were conquering not just the Byzantine lands but also Abbasid and Arab lands. Thinking the Muslims in Iberia, Arabia and the Levante had any semblance of unity and a desire to destroy the Christian world together is a laughable myth. 

But don't worry for some reason or another Conservatives recently have decided to talk about how these Crusades were a good thing and a defensive war - which I respond to.

In the 1800s and 1900s the term re-emerged as a racial construct for white groups in England and the US and still exists to this day. Conservatives were not happy when they were told recently that Anglo-Saxons never really existed as a unified people.

However for a long time women in games where usually objectified to a crazy degree with the likes of Final Fantasy's Tifa or Tomb Raider's Lara Croft being perfect examples. 

In recent times, lead female characters have become more realistic which has not gone down well with gamers. The Last of Us Part II's Abby being one of the most notable examples of this backlash - as gamers didn't take kindly to a visibly muscular women who wasn't conventionally attractive.

And because they can only think with their lower heads, they are also very mad about the new Fable lead character

AC4 also included Native groups in the Caribbean. 

However, playing a action game as an Aztec warrior fighting the Spanish invasion is a rare setting for a video game. The announcement of Encumene Aztec promoted a disgusting conservative backlash on twitter with many wishing they could actually play as the Spanish instead. 

And THEIR WISHES WERE GRANTEDD!! The Game Devs from Poland and now completed reworking the game so you can side with the Spanish against your own people - which is historically inaccurate for Aztec warriors and a clear attempt at pandering.

INSANE Conservative BACKLASH to New Aztec Game PROVES they are Far-Right,2023-06-03T04:20:00Z,PT32M58S,53979,3117,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"There have been a few notable games that see you play as Native Americans during the time of European colonisation. Probably the most famous is playing as Connor or Ratonhnhaké:ton, in Assassin's Creed III, who kinda weirdly helped the American revolution rather than side with the British like many Native groups did. AC4 also included Native groups in the Caribbean. 

However, playing a action game as an Aztec warrior fighting the Spanish invasion is a rare setting for a video game. The announcement of Encumene Aztec promoted a disgusting conservative backlash on twitter with many wishing they could actually play as the Spanish instead.

It feels like every issue has everyone falling on a firm side. Leftist BreadTubers vs Conservatives, woke vs anti-woke - but what if there was a different way? 

What about Centrism? 

Now many Centrist YouTubers may not think of themselves as such, but on a whole host of issues they are - which often leads their fans projecting more right leaning politics upon them. 

Today we are reviewing three creators who have had pretty 'reasonable' takes on big issues popping up on the internet. And I believe they all represent different things. 

Boogie is a centrist who is a centrist because he wants to be liked, Critikal is a centrist because he is pandering and is scared of annoying his audience if he completely spoke his mind, and SomeOrdinaryGamers appears to be the most principle of the free in that he seems to be a 'live and let live' type of centrist, maybe even libertarian.

Hasan and The Left's Paradoxical Relationship with Consumer Capitalism,2023-05-26T05:45:02Z,PT31M48S,37145,2107,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"We all live in a global capitalist economic system. As anti-capitalists we see the flaws, we hate the system, but we still have to live. Not participating is really not an option for most of us. As well as being exploited for our labour, we also participate as consumers. Spending thousands on consumer goods, likely made in the most unethical ways. This has led to the saying 'there is no ethical consumption under capitalism'

What once was a statement of fact, now has been taken as an excuse to essentially be a consumer without even thinking about the ethics involved of what you were buying. 

What helps Consumer Capitalism thrive is the ideology of materialism that sees what you own as a status symbol in society. As leftist, we are faced with a dilemma of how much we should participate in this. How much is too much? Is a 200k Car okay? How about a 50K car? 20K? Must we only buy the bare minimum? 

In this video I explore the paradoxical relationship between the left and consumer capitalism.

Since 2020, he's been steadily moving away from his old content, to the dismay of his legions of fans who loved his old edgelord persona. 

Recently, Ian iDubbbz took this a step further and released a lengthy apology video detailing how he was ignorant about the impact of his content and how he is truly sorry. 

This didn't go over well with his fans, who felt personally called out. Moist Critikal at a different take - iDubbbz shouldn't have apologised because there was nothing to apologise for - which prompted most of the YT and reddit comments to call him out.

WE NEED TO TALK about the INSANE Pro-Nazi Comments Sections of Hitler Videos,2023-05-20T04:00:15Z,PT38M14S,66345,3568,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Hitler is the most evil man in history. This statement is agreed upon by most people in the West no matter what side of the political spectrum they fall on. However, just because he has this reputation doesn't mean positive myths aren't spread about him. 

A few years back on a Joe Rogan podcast, Jordan Peterson said that in regards to Hitler you had to give !the devil his due', then listing positive aspects of Hitler including being a good painter (no) and working wonders for the German economy (a myth). 

This attitude reflect larger views held across the West that show some sort of 'admiration' for Hitler. Due to many of the Nazi Generals and soldiers writing the history of the war, and the allied effort to rehabilitate Germany to get the West on side with West Germany to fight the Communist bloc, myths about Nazi Germany have been allowed to thrive. 

This also includes Myths about Hitler and these usually revolve around painting him as the best orator of all time who hypnotised his people into doing what he wanted (thereby shifting the collective guilt away from the German people).

It is perhaps not surprising that YouTube videos that contain Hitler attract many many Nazis, which is obviously a big problem anyway, but interestingly also a lot of naive idiots who parrot widely held myths believed about Hitler - like him being some super genius economist. 

In this video we look at this and debunk Hitler myths

The DARK Reason Japan has MILLIONS of Vending Machines (Capitalism LOVES Coffee Drinkers),2023-05-19T04:22:00Z,PT34M49S,22889,1264,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Japan has millions of vending machines, with many of them selling caffeinated drinks. Monster, Boss Coffee, some weird energy drink you've never heard of. In my visits to Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto, I noticed most vending machines I saw largely stocked these drinks.

It's no secret that coffee powers the capitalist workforce. In the UK, it's estimated 80% of the population drink coffee every single day, and this doesn't factor in others who drink Tea and energy drinks. We are addicted to this stimulant and so many of us rely on it to get through the mundanity of 9-5 work. 

Japan itself has a particular brutal form of office work - long hours, pressure not to take time off, not leaving before the boss - some people work 80 hours a week. Japan's vending machines and convenience stores are everywhere - but are they actually serving a more sinister purpose than convenience ???

The Coronation of King Charles Has Made The UK LOSE ITS MIND (again),2023-05-06T09:00:29Z,PT27M9S,39774,2421,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Today is the day - King Charles III is being crowed King of the UK and ruler of the Empire. After the unfortunate, untimely, unjust, cruel, unthinkable, unconscionable passing of her royal highness, Elizabeth II, Charles is finally assuming the role he was born to do. 

The billionaire Monarch is having his £100 million pound coronation paid for by the UK taxpayer. If you thought the country would stop being weird after the Queen's passing, then think again. 

People being urged to pledge allegiance to the king? £8million pounds being spent on sending his portrait round the country? kids being forced to chant pro-monarchy slogans? You'll find them all in Britain over the last couple months. 

.00:00:00 - Why can't the UK be normal!? 
00:04:00 - Charles is a billionaire but we are paying for the Coronation 
00:08:50 - PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO CHARLES III
00:13:50 - The Govt are forcing the coronation on us 
00:19:00 - Who are the people that love Charles ???
00:24:25 - The Monarchy needs propaganda to survive

Steven Crowder and The Conservative War against Women Divorcing their Husbands,2023-05-05T05:50:00Z,PT31M49S,66064,3111,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Steven Crowder recently announced he was going through a divorce for essentially just being a terrible human being and husband. However, instead of taking accountability, he proceeded to actually attack divorce rights in his state of Texas. In Texas, like most of the US, either married person can initiate divorce for any reasons - known as a no fault divorce. 

However, while it seems like a fringe position, ending no fault divorce is actually very popular with conservative pundits and might be a new piece of legislation the GOP may start to attack.

The games also feature prominent LGBT representation and relationships.

If I could describe his sense of humour it would be a mix between 2010 Reddit meets 2009 Chuck Norris memes (which is probably the same thing). Musk pretty much bought twitter to unban the Babylon Bee's account because it promoted him so much, and now spends his days stealing other Twitter users memes and sharing them as his own. 

Elon Musk's jokes are painful to anyone who isn't a sycophant - but why is he so unfunny? How is he so oblivious to how cringe inducing his jokes are? I try to answer this in the video.

The show sees couples agree to get married before they even see eachother after a week or so long dating period. 

However, just like with a lot of game shows and reality TV shows, the profit motive of creating such shows often means the contestants are treated as commodities and not as human beings. This week multiple former Love is Blind contestants spoke of gross treatment and bordering on inhumane conditions while they participated in the show - including prominent figures of season 2.

Hasan also recently went to Japan and also loved it. He made a few videos talking about the politics and economics of Japan and said that while it has many serious problems, Capitalism in Japan works better than America for example.

Whether it was due to conflict in the Middle East or Bush's America, the voices of Christopher Hitchens, Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris seemed to be resonating with many.

This saw them all being booked on some of the biggest news and current affairs shows and they all had best selling books on the issue of religion. 

However in 2022, the movements appeal has drastically waned and people simply don't seem to care anymore. I analyse why they had such a dramatic fall in this video.

Jon Stewart and The Limits of Exposing Conservative Hypocrisy,2023-04-01T03:00:17Z,PT32M40S,32508,1769,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"John Stewart is going viral on social media fairly regularly due to his new Apple TV Show. There have been multiple clips of his interviews with various Republican politicians that have gone viral due to John very clearly pointing out their hypocrisy on a whole host of political issues. 

As left leaning people, we watch these clips, we enjoy them. John makes them squirm in a way MSM probably is not capable of. But I asked myself when watching these clips - does this actually change anyone's mind? 

Because it misses the obvious point that these GOP politicians aren't finding out they are hypocrites after John exposes them, they have either been paid and/or choose to be hypocrites on political issues to gain power. 

And in that sense will anyone who is Republican change their minds after seeing John Stewart expose their hypocrisy? How effective is it in changing the mind of the undecided? 

.00:00:00 - We like exposing Conservative hypocrisy 
00:05:50 - We are all hypocrites but politicians are the worst 
00:07:50 - Does exposing the Average Joe Conservative's hypocrisy matter?
00:14:00 - John Stewart Exposes the hypocrisy of Republican Politicians
00:17:30 - GOP politicians are bought off - they don't care 
00:22:38 - John Stewart exposes them even more 
00:26:00 - Does this change anyone's mind?

However, he did have a short lived career and played some interesting roles considering his political beliefs. 

Knowles hasn't starred in too many noteworthy things, but his performance in a student film The House of Shades has drawn some attention lately due to his performance of a gay character. Since this film aired he has been notorious for attacking the LGBT community. 

I thought it would be fun to do a little review.

Whether it was his hatred of the British Monarchy, capitalism or the Conservative party, it was pretty clear Russell was on the left. 

Over the last two or so years, Old Russell has been shifting more and more into the right. His YouTube channel usually targets popular right-wing villains like Joe Biden and Dr Fauci while pretty much ignoring the problems on the right wing. 

Recently, Brand also signed a deal with Rumble, a right wing video site, before going on a whole host of Conservative media and Fox News. Russell Brand speaks glowingly of Tucker Carlson, Ben Shapiro and others seemingly ignoring how much damage they have done and are doing to America.

Bad Conservative Actors BLAME 'WOKE' Hollywood for their FAILED Careers,2023-03-22T03:00:19Z,PT28M20S,91986,3549,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Hollywood started off as an industry that was firmly in bed with conservative corporations and the US government. In the late 1960s, and early 1970s, new young film makers and creatives like Martin Scorsese, Brian De Palma, Oliver Stone, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola ushered in a new era of Hollywood. Films emerged that would challenge the status quo and comment on the failures of the American system and its overseas and domestic politics. This firmly shifted Hollywood away from its conservative roots, with the likes of conservative actors like John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart and Ronald Reagan also being replaced by younger liberal actors. 

However, Conservative actors and film makers have still always had a place in Hollywood. Clint Eastwood and Mel Gibson have been nominated for multiple Oscars for acting and directing, while others like James Woods, Gary Sinese and Vince Vaughn have also had successful careers in liberal Hollywood. 

However, some conservative actors failed for some reason or another. And one of the main reasons they believe is they have been censored and blacklisted by supposed 'woke' liberal Hollywood.

It has been one of the most watched TV shows in recent years and also received critical acclaim. It follows the 2013 game very closely, expanding the world and story in some instances and in others taking scenes directly from the game. 

However, Conservatives were already chomping at the bit to attack this show. The Last of Us Part II became a massive culture war/grifting opportunity for many Anti-SJW nerd channels after it was leaked the game would feature LGBT representation, which was also present in the first game.

So when there was expanded LGBT representation in the HBO show they were ready to pump out their videos attacking its 'wokeness'.

And shortly after he was taking L after L. Last month, his video about helping treat people with partial blindness went viral for all the wrong reasons. Beastie Boy got very defensive and started attacking critics of him, basically doing his best Elon Musk impression. 

Not satisfied with this, Beast also recently implored his followers to take to Walmarts accross the world to neatly stack the shelves with his own chocolate (unpaid of course) which prompted a huge social media backlash. Instead of defending himself, Beast donated 100k to charity for some reason. 

This week he unveiled his newest video, his charity team went to a poor area of South Africa to give school students shoes so they wouldn't have to miss class - which prompted a further backlash causing Beastie to get even more defensive. 

And we thought he was such an angel doing charity work out of the kindness of his heart.

Marjorie Taylor Greene and The Conservative Cult of CrossFit,2023-03-02T03:00:19Z,PT30M40S,50165,1971,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Over the last two decades CrossFit has swept America. The exercise regimes/Gym franchise/competitive sport has spawned communities throughout America but also the wider western world. However, it has always had a reputation for both being fairly culty but also spreading conservative politics, embodied by multiple CrossFit workouts being named after US soldiers and even LAPD cops. 

Marjorie Taylor Greene has published many videos on her social media pages of her participating in CrossFit exercises which is often met with ridicule. However, Greene even had her own CrossFit affiliated gym before she entered Congress and was also an instructor at her gym. 

The brand has been embroiled in controversy since its CEO and Founder retired due to comments about a variety of controversial issues.

They have described themselves as anti-woke counter culture warriors fighting back against the perceived over extension of liberal feminism. 

However, in recent months they have been pivoting hard to focusing on a Muslim audience. Tate especially is popular with young Muslim men with his controversial message on woman and his conservative politics. Both Tate and Sneako say they have converted to Islam basically because it is apparently anti-woke.

The latest Ant-man was savaged by critics who especially focused on the terrible CGI that is seen throughout the film. However, audiences also criticised the story and how the film essentially only serves as a set up for future movies. 

However there are more issues at play. Audiences are getting bored with the extremely formulaic and sterile worlds now being shown on screen and also there is a reason why the special effects have become so terrible. Marvel is notorious for treating its contractors terribly, meddling with scenes until the last minute, blacklisting companies that stand up for themselves, and setting wildly unrealistic deadlines for work. Many VFX workers describe them as the worst client but one they have to keep because they dominate the film industry.

The show is set in a world ravaged by a viral fungus leaving the survivors to fight amongst themselves to reestablish some amout of control. 

It's no secret at this point that 'zombie' books, movies, TV shows and games aren't really about the zombies anymore, instead using it as a backdrop to explore different aspects of humanity and what humans do in these brutal conditions. 

However, failed screenplay writer Ben Shapiro seems to not be up to date on his zombie media tropes. In his review for Episode 3 of the Last of Us, he whined about the lack of Zombies in his zombie show! Because zombie shows are of course only supposed to be about the zombies.

Hogwarts Legacy released to widespread acclaim from the gaming press and saw millions of people tune into Twitch to watch how the anticipated game played.

However, many streamers faced a backlash from their audience due to their being a boycott of the game due to JK Rowling. The influencer and gaming press started running stories that the left were bullying streamers out of playing the game because they were so evil.

Netflix’s REAL LIFE Squid Game is a ‘Brutal' and 'Inhumane’ DISASTER,2023-02-08T03:00:17Z,PT26M53S,31579,1570,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Neftlix’s Squid Game TV show was the widely successful Korean television show that depicted a dystopian near future setting where people in South Korea would take part in the Squid Game to win a massive cash prize. The show was a critique of capitalism but also more specifically focuses on Korea’s insane predatory debt crisis that has seen so many of the population (including the show’s creator) being forced into a life of misery. 

Well Netflix (and Mr Beast before) had the amazing idea of creating an in real life Squid Game. Beastie boys original effort debuted shortly after the show ended, and cost about 3 million dollars with the winner making off with about 250,000 dollars. While stupid, it was relatively harmless. 

Netflix’s IRL Show has far bigger stakes. The winner will take home $4.56 million. However, a recent report has come out from contestants of the show which make it apparent that the IRL version has more similarities to its counterpart than just aesthetics. Reports of freezing temperatures, lack of food, and multiple contestants needing serious medical attention, the IRL Squid Game appears to be just as dystopian as its on screen brother.

Originally getting famous for stupid viral videos which would often run 20 hours in length, he began to pivot to big giveaways in his videos and eventually charity work. This week, Mr Beast debuted his new video which received a hugely positive reaction. However, because some snarky Twitter leftists (myself included) didn't really care for the video, Mr Beast seemed hurt as he tweeted his frustration at the backlash he received. 

Many of his fans, mostly younger people, conservatives or enlightened centrists, couldn't understand why anyone could attack or criticise Mr Beast. He helped people, and apparently uses all his money just for charity and nothing else! 

I've been an early critic of Mr Beast and in this video I go through the reasons why people may hate him and his content and argue against some of the popular arguments that are supposed to prove he is a truly selfless guy.

Anti-SJW GAMERS Are MAD Leftists are Boycotting Hogwarts Legacy because of JK Rowling,2023-01-26T03:00:02Z,PT29M21S,43400,2081,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"It's no secret that the gaming community overall is pretty reactionary. They are also mostly pro-capitalists, despite often boycotting games for capitalism - like Star Wars Battlefront II back in 2017. 

You’d think as capitalists they would support consumer boycott movements. After all, isn’t the point of consumer capitalism that people get to vote with their wallets? 

Well apparently no, they don’t support this one. Many people in the Trans community have asked others not to buy the upcoming Hogwarts Legacy because it will personally benefit JK Rowling. For many leftists this is pretty easy. On a personal level, not wanting to make JK even richer makes sense, in terms of a wider movement, if it could hurt her reputation in the eyes of WB then that would also be a good thing. Star Wars Battlefront only needed to underperform by 1 million units for EA to see it as a failure and make a big u-turn on their monetisation practices - doesn’t it seem reasonable to think a boycott against Hogwarts Legacy could at least make the game underperform?

In the video we talk about the pros and cons of consumer boycotts and why it is really the bare minimum not to buy the game if you want to show a little solidarity with the trans community.

In our first video we looked at the 'Greatest Conservative' video games, that hilariously included Bioshock, Red Dead and Metal Gear Solid. In our second we looked at movies, which included Fight Club and Dredd, and now we have TV Shows.

Steven Crowder recently called out a vague 'Big Con' which he claims was a conservative media organisation in bed with Big Tech. They also offered him a $50 million contract to sign with them for 4 years.

This happened to be the Daily Wire. 

Part of the terms were that Crowder would suffer financial losses if his channel was demonetised or totally removed by YouTube - so he alleged this was them trying to buy his values so he would adhere to YouTube TOS. 

Daily Wire fired back, trying to say that Crowder had simply taking the offer the wrong way, before Crowder leaked a phone call where he and the Daily Wire were discussing terms where they came across in a negative light. 

Now the Daily Wire team are attacking Crowder pretty viciously, with Crowder promising to expose them even more.

However, whether they like it or not some of the most successful games in history have contained both political messaging and left-wing themes. Metal Gear Solid, Watch Dogs, Fallout and others have all contained anti-capitalist and anti-American themes. 

Some Conservatives don't really accept this though. To justify their love for a game they simply ignore the obvious political messaging and even go as far to claim that obvious left wing games actually promote conservative values. 

Recently, I came across a post on a Conservative Wikipedia clone that had an extensive list of the 'Greatest Conservative Video Games' ever made - and I thought it would be fun to read through them.

Why Ben Shapiro has so many TERRIBLE Movie Takes,2023-01-06T03:00:01Z,PT34M48S,84302,2999,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Ben Shapiro went viral over the Holidays due to a review of Rian Johnson's Glass Onion. He complained that the movie spent too much time setting up a misdirect and used to many tropes from the genre. It seems to many he kinda missed the point. He also then complained about the alleged lazy liberal politics which basically hurt his feelings. 

But Ben Shapiro has a long history of pretty terrible movie takes. It is of course fine not to like any entertainment product, but the reasons Ben Shapiro gives for not liking things are often very weird. 

In the video we also contrast what Ben's sees as negatives in film versus what he actually included in his own work, especially his political thriller novels.

However, there are issues that YouTube needs to address itself and problems that are internet in monetising your passions.

In Christianity traditionally, people who take their own lives don’t get admitted into heaven. Most supporters of MAiD type legislation are on the left.

Canada has some of the most liberal MAiD laws in the world and has even expanded this recently to long term sufferers or mental health. In a vacuum, people have supporter this. However, there have been numerous stories in Canada of impoverished disabled people having medical professional recommend that they get euthanised rather than continue to receive expensive treatment. Other examples have seen disabled people apply for MAiD rather than go homeless. 

While Canada does have many safeguards in check, it’s rampant cost cutting measures taking place to its welfare policies leave people choosing to die rather than the hardship of poverty. But to many capitalists, ‘kill all the poor’ isn’t a bad thing.

A purported plot by the liberal left to destroy American tradition from making people use ‘happy holidays’ to getting rid of Christmas decorations on Starbucks cups. 

The supposed Christmas conflict has dragged on for nearly two decades with no end in sight. But I’ll admit, it’s seeming a little desperate now as Fox News cling to random and irrelevant stories to push this narrative.

The DOWNFALL of The Liver King and How He EXPLOITED Toxic Male Body Standards,2022-12-22T03:00:08Z,PT35M12S,22840,1197,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"The Downfall of the Liver King has been widely reported across YouTube. The 45 year old fitness influencer claimed to be all natural, creating his impressive physique through a diet of raw meat, primarily liver, but also other animal bones and organs. He also sold these ingredients in his supplements which he would film himself constantly eating. 

However, it was revealed that The Liver King actually was taking a huge amount of PEDs which was managed by his team. The Liver King also ate a varied and pretty healthy diet, showing that the red meat heavy meals he ate on TikTok weren't reflective of his reality. 

To me what the Liver King represents is the exploitation of toxic male body standards. With his claim to be natural, he was selling people an achievable body even if you were over 40, by just following his workout program and eating liver - no potentially dangerous PEDs necessary.

This was met with near universal backlash - even from his biggest simps that include Jack Dorsey and Mr Beast. 

Even The Quartering actually turned on Elon for a brief second before backtracking. In the aftermath, Elon put out a poll which would decide if he would remain Twitter CEO or resign. This sent The Quartering into an absolute Twitter frenzy even begging Mr Beast to take back his criticism of Elon Musk.

A terrible presidency that's main 'achievement' was huge tax cuts for the rich, and now he spirals further into madness on his own social media platform. He recently announced his presidential run for 2024 to a quite muted reaction. Many Conservative were already drifting toward supporting Florida Governor Ron DeSantis instead of Trump. 

However, what has seem to make Conservatives turn away from Trump in record numbers was his announcement yesterday that he would be launching his own line of NFTs, which seem fitting for a man who has a long history of being a con artist but for some reason still shocked many of his hardcore fans.

The God they once worshipped has turned out to be a completely incompetent CEO with his takeover of Twitter, which was pretty much done to unban the Babylon Bee. 

However, with his Twitter purchases, Elon Musk has been pandering more and more to the hard right of the American conservative movement. Musk built his fanbase on his supposed care for climate change with his Tesla cars, and dreams of travelling the stars. But now with him pandering to these conservatives, many in his fanbase are now seriously doubting if he was ever genuine.

They have faced widespread backlash for years for what they have done. 

Recently, Oli had an announcement. They no longer identified as a woman but now as a man, who had also found Christianity and was now a conservative political activist. Oli has now been doing the conservative media rounds (Fox News, GB News, OAN) blaming the woke left and their ideology as the reason they went through their journey as a self identified Korean person...

Elon Musk and The DYSTOPIAN Billionaire Obsession with BREEDING,2022-12-09T08:12:00Z,PT27M50S,54713,2613,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"The earth’s population hit around 8 billion people last month, and is set to continue to increase until the 2080s where it is predicted to hit over 10 billion people. Many people have discussed how this will affect the world and the environment, and the consensus is in our global capitalist system, the expanding population will produce many challenges in terms of food, fuel and water availability as well as habitable land. Of course, if we didn’t live in a world that puts profits over everything then population increase could be tackled effectively. 

While many people are worried about population increase, some of the ultra wealthy actually believe we are going towards a population collapse - chief among them Elon Musk. Despite not offering much evidence of why this is a global problem, Musk uses the example of Japan to outline why population decline will be a disaster. However, cherry picking certain EU countries, Japan and the US is not evidence that there will be population decline, nor that it will destroy the planet. 

It seems Musk is more worried about less people accepting dire economic conditions that force them into working for terrible companies, like many of those that Musk owns. It seems that the billionaires want an increasing population forever as an infinite labour pool for their business interests. 

Musk himself has had ten children, 9 still alive, and has had 4 in the last 3 years.

The Right-Wing VS Left-Wing BATTLE Over The Politics of Sonic the Hedgehog,2022-12-02T03:00:10Z,PT31M24S,18456,1145,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Sonic The Hedgehog is one of the most beloved console mascot characters born in the 1990s, and after Mario has been the most popular and the most enduring. Sonic has been making a comeback lately, with two successful and well received live action movies and recently a new game Sonic Frontiers which opened to both commercial and also some decent critical success. I personally really like it the soundtrack is a 10/10! 

However, over the last few years there has been a growing divide on the politics of the blue hedgehog. The right have claim Movie Sonic as a warrior against woke culture supposedly taking over entertainment. Much more fitting, Sonic has been a leftist icon and for good reason. Sonic was conceived as a game with a message about the environment and SEGA itself has shown itself to be one of the better Japanese companies when it comes to championing equality.

The constant bragging about how macho he was, constantly talking about his personal and business success and how much people loved him. If you missed Trump, you may like Nick Adams. 

A Conservative Australian who migrated to the US, Nick Adams has wrote multiple books about his immigrant experience and how great Donald Trump is - which of course has led to Nick actually meeting his idol. 

Nick now spends his time tweeting about how much of an Alpha Male he is, how smart he is and of course… how much he loves Hooters…?

It seems the organisers of the FIFA 2022 Qatar World Cup must have missed the multiple documentaries covering the scandal, because they seem to have created an even worse version of the doomed music festival. 

To expensive basic accommodation in the middle of nowhere, to empty stadiums and migrant workers being paid to be fans, the Qatar World Cup has been a joke and a monument to how capitalism is increasing ruining football. Although I'll admit the actual football on the pitch has been great.

*AUDIO IS BAD IN THIS ONE - It is very crackly for some reason, hopefully just a one off*

Kanye 'Ye' West has become notorious over the last month or so for his insanely antisemitic comments. This in turn has garnered him a brand new fanbase, American's Alt-Right Fascists who love Kanye's comments on Jewish people. 

Kanye ran a miserable campaign for President in 2020 and has recently announced he is running for President again in 2024. He also announced Milo Yiannopoulos is his campaign manager, formerly a major part of the Alt-Right before his fall from 'grace'. 

In this video we talk about why Nazis are flocking to Kanye and if is campaign will amount to anything.

Why Jordan Peterson's Muslim Fans have TURNED ON HIM,2022-11-18T03:00:13Z,PT30M39S,66650,2706,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Jordan Peterson's following stretches all over the globe. I have seen his books sold in Vietnam and they are popular works in the Middle East. Since Jordan Peterson constantly promotes the virtues of the Christian West, it seems surprising he would have many Muslim fans. His conservative politics and fight against leftism has appealed to more Conservative Muslim communities. 

However, Petey has bit off more than he can chew. In the Summer, he felt the need to lecture Muslims about how they should actually try to be more peaceful which prompted a swift backlash from various Muslim intellectuals and YouTubers. Recently, it seems many who hadn't already abandoned him are now doing so after Jordan Peterson visited Israel and had dinner with Netanyahu and Ben Shapiro.

The former Conservative rising star had a huge fall from grace around 2018, and was fading into obscurity. Last December, he was relegated to being a salesman on a Catholic Shopping Network advertising biblical statues. It seemed a happy ending to his controversial career. 

However, while at rock bottom Milo was given a lifeline. Earlier this year, he was made a intern at the congressional office of Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene. Recently he made an appearance on Tim Pool's podcast which went down very well with Tim's audience. Milo criticised DeSantis and blamed mainstream republicans for sabotaging Trumpian candidates while also spewing the same garbage he always has done. The weirdest part being he has seemingly trained himself to speak in an entirely different voice lol.

Lovingly calling themselves the Muskrats, his fanbase can't stop telling everyone they know how great he is. They love his memes, his sense of humour that resembles a 55 year old stepdad going through his second divorce, his inventions like... a tunnel underground. Many became Muskrats due to their belief that Elon would save the planet with his expensive electric cars, or take us to Mars by 2022! Which hasn't happened.

However, many did not sign on for Musk's political views which recently seen him exclusively pander to Republicans even telling people to only vote the GOP in the midterms. His handling of Twitter since he became CEO has also sent his fans into a downward spiral due to how terrible he has handled his new role.

Bill Maher's GROSS Support for Israel (Will DEFEND any War Crime!),2022-11-05T03:00:01Z,PT41M21S,25176,1536,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Bill Maher earned a reputation as an outspoken atheist who would often confront Christian Conservatives hold on America's politics. He was a critic of the Bush administration and early critic of the Iraq War which wasn't common on US TV. However, he has also shown over the last decade how he views Islam as the greatest evil in religion. Which inevitably informs his views of Israel-Palestine. 

Like many New Atheist types, Bill Maher is also a Western Chauvinist and believes Israel to be moral and just because it has western style 'rights', while Gaza has no redeeming features due to Islamist influence. Bill Maher constantly defends most Israel actions and feels that the US media and politicians are actually so pro-Palestinian he must use his popular TV show to defend Israel and bring on Netanyahu to say that progressives in Congress are actually the real racists. 

In this video we break down Maher's consistent defence of Israel.

The World of US Military TikTok CRINGE (And Reddit!),2022-11-04T03:00:15Z,PT29M36S,22308,1446,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Many US Soldiers sign up to the military to take advantage of the many benefits only an enlisted person can get. This is by design. Increasingly it seems more and more recruits are only in it to improve their material conditions.

But don’t worry, there are still plenty of US servicemen who sign up for all the wrong reasons, because they love their country. And they have no problem posting this on social media decked out in a full military uniform.

There are multiple subreddits dedicated to promoting the virtues of Freedom and Democracy that America supposedly represents with its members beliving this should be exported around the globe. Basically neoconservatism repackaged by Gen Z for the 2020s.

He has gained a massive following in various different communities. Recently, he has been gaining a larger following for his conservative politics and him joining Ben Shapiro's Daily Wire to make both free and exclusive content for members. 

However, he got his mainstream start with his famous book 12 Rules For Life, a self help book. He has given hours upon hours of lectures giving people advice for various things including addiction. He himself suffers from this, but his advice is often lacking - focusing on the individual and their own responsibility to overcome their issues rather than seek medical attention. Obviously, hypocritical l coming from a man who himself needed a dangerous medical procedure to help treat his own problems.

'SAVE THE ANGLO-SAXON RACE!' - Matt Walsh and Conservatives INSANE Belief they are 'Anglo-Saxons',2022-10-21T02:30:15Z,PT27M36S,40207,2077,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Anglo-Saxon England met its end at the hand of the Norman Invasion in 1066, and met its final fate in 1071. The Normans fundamentally changed England and what would later become the UK, but that hasn't stop many Americans and British from claiming they are Anglo-Saxons. This racial identity has its roots in the birth of Protestantism but took its modern shape in the mid-1800s as a way for Northern Europeans, Germanic people and English to differentiate themselves from other white groups of people. In short -  saying they were better than the rest of the them. 

This identity rears its head in characters like Tom Buchanan in The Great Gatsby, and several Founding Fathers believed the US was the successor state to Saxon England (among others like Sparta, Athens and Rome). Seemingly relegated to the days of European and American early 20th century colonialism, the identity is making a comeback now that US conservatives are shedding any mask they may have had. Last year, Matt Gaetz, Marjorie Taylor Greene and other republicans declared they were basing a caucus on the traditions and identity of the Anglo-Saxons. In a recently leaked audio tape, Daily Wire pundit Matt Walsh has been heard decrying the supposed extinction of the Anglo-Saxon race due to immigration from Latin America. 

The term Anglo-Saxon, is one that never really made much sense. The originals 'Anglo-Saxon' settlers compromised the groups of The Angles, The Saxons, The Jutes and The Frisians. Although some having common relations and ancestry these groups were not even the same, before invading and settling England, which had been under a cosmopolitan Roman Occupation for hundreds of years, and England itself already contained multiple different groups of people before the invasion. To say Saxon England was built on a melting pot of cultures would be accurate and that is before the Vikings and Normans both invaded and settled themselves. 

Anglo-Saxon identity is a myth based on bad science and social construction of a exclusive identity. It doesn't hold up to any scrutiny but says so much about the people who claim to be an 'Anglo-Saxon' in 2022.

She then went on to reveal that she has been in an abusive marriage for years where her partner controls all her finances and social media profiles which he threatens to destroy if she doesn’t do what he wants. 

The shocking revelations have sparked an outpouring of sympathy from the twitch community including many of her fans. However, there has been a backlash. Many people are doubting the concrete evidence they have seen while some have compared her to Amber Heard, or the situation to the trial of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp. Some prominent creators have also felt that now is the opportunity to crack jokes at Amouranth’s expense or call her a con artist and a scammer for going along with what her abusive husband made her do.

The NEXT George Carlin? Bill Burr ATTACKS Capitalism and DEFENDS Socialism,2022-10-15T02:30:05Z,PT30M57S,33518,1964,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"George Carlin is a comedian that the right-wing constantly holds up as a champion of free speech, assured that if he were still alive today that he would be firmly in the conservative camp. This of course flew in the face of everything he said about politics which were firmly left wing until his last taped comedy performance. 

Bill Burr has accumulated a large fanbase across the political spectrum and has a strong conservative audience. These conservatives have lauded Bill Burr for calling out Hilary Clinton and CNN, but misunderstand the angle he was coming from. In a clip from his podcast, from December 2021, that has recently gone viral - Bill Burr defended socialism against right-wing criticism and spent about 5 minutes talking about all the ways that capitalism is destroying America. 

Bill Burr, like many comedians, believes in free speech to an almost absolutist degree, but unlike many mainstream comedians lazily pandering to the right-wing, Burr has constantly said what he thinks about politics without deliberately grifting. While attacking liberal white feminism and the Democrats haven’t earned him many fans in the centrist liberal camp, it seems his problems with liberalism stem from an anti-corporate stance rather than a right wing conservative capitalist one.

Embodied by the election of billionaire con artist Donald Trump, the American business landscape is littered by wannabe entrepreneurs hoping they can crush their fellow man to join the 1%. 

With a massive desire for so many to ‘make it’ in business, a side industry has popped up which is other businessmen making ‘motivational’ seminars and podcasts to make the hopeful next Zuckerberg part with his money to learn something from an industry insider. 

Recently, this has taken another even more ridiculous turn - the rise of the Alpha Male Entrepreneur that prioritises brotherhood and fitness, and talks about selling cars as if he was storming the beaches of France in 1944.

The Conservative DEFENCE of Kanye PROVES They Don’t Care about Right-Wing Anti-Semitism,2022-10-13T02:00:03Z,PT32M40S,26926,1460,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Kanye West has firmly aligned himself with US Republicans in recent years. Despite starting a fire storm during the presidency of George Bush for saying he didn’t care about black people, Ye was a vocal supporter of Donald Trump and even met him at the White House in 2018 while wearing a MAGA hat. Ye then would make a half assed attempt and running for president himself. 

He has now been embroiled in more controversy after he said he would go ‘Defcon 3’ on ‘the Jews’ because of a feud with Puff Diddy after he promoted clothes with a ‘White Lives Matter Slogan’. He then tweeted more antisemitic dog whistles before cut footage of his recent interview with Tucker Carlson showed him saying more antisemitic things. 

The Conservative reaction has largely been to defend Kanye or lightly condemn him while saying what he said wasn’t as bad as mild criticism of Israel. Ben Shapiro did actually say it was antisemitic while also praising Kanye for becoming more Conservative. Candace Owens lept to his defence while the Jewish Chronicle ran a story saying we should forgive him. 

Kanye West’s comments where wildly antisemitic yet few conservatives have come out with any strong condemnation of him. However, they are quick to label non-Jewish critics of Israel anti-semites. When Bernie Sanders called Netanyahu a racist, Ben Shapiro said Bernie was as ‘Jewish as a ham sandwich.’

Donald Trump, who has a long history of antisemitism, was also giving a pass by these same people, with Israel even naming a town built on stolen Syrian land after him. 

At this point, it is clear that conservatives don’t actually care about antisemitism on the right as long as these types don’t say anything about Israel or support the nation state. To them, the only form of legit antisemitism is criticism of Israel.

INSANE Conservatives WON’T STOP The War Against FURRIES (FURRY PANIC),2022-10-08T02:00:15Z,PT23M51S,18104,1191,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"The GOP have been ramping up the various culture wars since they lost power in all branches of government following the 2020 election. From Cancel Culture to CRT, the list of manufactured culture war issues is endless. 

Back in February, a new moral panic emerged among conservative circles - Furries. While this was debunked many times, it seems to have been revived due to the 2022 election for the next Governor of Colorado. GOP nominee Heidi Ganahl has made it a key issue and has tripled down on the furry panic.

In this video we discuss how this panic shows no sign of slowing down.

"The Politics and Anti-Asian Racism of Cyberpunk (Blade Runner, Cyberpunk 2077 and Orientalism)",2022-10-07T02:00:04Z,PT39M19S,31570,1523,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Cyberpunk has been seeing a resurgence in recent years. The sequel to one of the fathers of Cyberpunk, 1982’s Blade Runner, was released on this day in 2017. Cyberpunk 2077 released in 2020 with the wildly successful anime Cyberpunk Edgerunners releasing this month. 

Looking back at Blade Runner 40 years later and 2049 five years later, we can analyse how Cyberpunk has changed over its near 50 year history and how 2049 serves as a nice blueprint of how to create a Cyberpunk world that is not based in problematic tropes about Asian peoples and cultures.

Why Jordan Peterson Keeps Inspiring Movie Villains - And Why he Can't Stop CRYING About it,2022-10-05T02:00:05Z,PT28M45S,36804,1867,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Jordan Peterson has gone from controversial to notorious over his journey from eccentric professor to Conservative Political pundit. His self-help stuff has fallen by the wayside as he has decided upon his culture war pursuits and joined up with ultra-conservative outlet The Daily Wire. 

Last year, Peterson found out he had inspired a version of Red Skull in a Marvel Comic which parodied how he offered young men an explanation of why society and women had supposedly neglected and forget about them. A month ago, Director Olivia Wilde said that the villain in her film Don’t Worry Darling was inspired by Jordan Peterson and was played by Chris Pine. 

We go through the drama and try to understand how Peterson can’t reflect on the damage he has done in the wake of being depicted as a villain multiple times.

With Trumpism taking over the GOP the explicit Far-Right sentiments have only grown and become more mask off. Whether that is Tucker Carlson pushing every kind of racist conspiracy theory, DeSantis’s war on the LGBT community or the admiration for European fascist or collaboration with explicit American Neo-Nazis. 

Recently, Italy elected a fascist Prime Minister, someone who has praised Mussolini and attended Fascist Youth Camps inspired by Lord of the Rings and Julius Evola. This was widely celebrated across the Republican party and Conservative media class. 

In this video we talk about how US conservatism has a history with fascism and how its time to wake up and realise fascism is here now.

In our age of social media, the Landlord class not only wants to get away with their theft and exploitation, they also want to be loved by the rest of us. This has led many of them to make videos on TikTok and YouTube explaining how they accumulated their vast property portfolios while also telling us why Communism is bad  (lmao)

There have been many comedians and funny people who have had conservative politics, but when conservatives try to make comedy based around conservative politics it is often lame - as they will never be self critical or question the status quo due to the very nature of conservative politics. 

The Babylon Bee, a former Christian satire outlet, has also tried to make funny content based on conservative politics after its buyout, which mostly has results in unfunny pop culture references and simping for their favourite conservative businessman or politician like Elon Musk.

However, in recent years he has gained millions of conservative followers due to him taking issues in a right-wing point of view. 

Russell has always been against the Royal Family, and this is something that has been far more consistent even in recent years. He used to be very outspoken towards the Queen herself and not just the Royal Family. 

However, after her passing Russell has been very careful with his words and has tried to both sides the issue, coming out and saying he appreciates the POV of both monarchists and anti-monarchists. This is a symptom of him realising that coming out and saying his real feelings about the Queen and the monarchy would lose him many fans.

This may be suprising due to the more grizzled tough guy character he has cultivated over the years. 

Jon now hosts a podcast called Real Ones where he interviews a whole host of people from his acting friends, to lawyers and teachers but one group that stands out the most is cops. Jon has had police on four separate podcasts and often discusses the controversy of the profession. However, Jon and his guests framing always takes a pro-police position and frames those who want significant reform as 'ridiculous' - which Jon himself as called movements to Defund the Police. 

In this video we discuss Jon's pro-Cop episodes of his podcast and analyse the arguments put forward by his guests.

INSANE Anti-SJW BACKLASH to Rings of Power and Why the Far-Right have ALWAYS Loved Tolkien and LOTR,2022-09-08T03:30:02Z,PT35M1S,29398,1347,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Amazon’s Rings of Power has recently debuted to massive viewership and decent reviews. The show tells a prequel story to the Lord of the Rings focusing on how the rings were created and how Sauron rose to power. 

Conservatives had it out for this show for a long time due to it having a diverse cast for its elves and dwarfs. Many have said that it spits in the face of Tolkien’s legacy. Many liberals have leapt to its defence painting Tolkien as a liberal progressive who hated bigotry.

While the backlash is ridiculous, painting Tolkien as some sort of liberal is equally absurd. Tolkien was a traditionalist Catholic monarchist, he hated socialism and support Franco in the 1930s. He constantly rejected any leftist reading of the Lord of the Rings by left wing university students in the 1960s. 

In this video we discuss the backlash and Tolkien’s actual legacy.

'GAYS AGAINST GROOMERS!' - How Dave Rubin and Gay Conservatives Are SELLING OUT the LGBT Community,2022-09-06T03:15:00Z,PT33M38S,24860,1476,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"The LGBT community has historically leaned left due to their marginalisation by general society. Progress in the LGBT communities fight for civil rights has in recent decades allowed members of the community to marry and adopt children. 

However, there is now a minor movement, headed by prominent LGBT conservatives, to ally themselves with the American conservative movement who are actively rolling back rights for gay and trans people with an eye on repealing gay marriage all together - based on statements from conservatives members of the Supreme Court.  

Dave Rubin is probably the most famous of these. Once a progressive pundit on TYT, Rubin took his own TYT show independent after disagreeing with Cenk Uyger about New Atheism and the support for Israel - something Dave Rubin was and is a massive supporter of. From there he changed from a liberal to a classical liberal to then a straight up conservative - even expressing doubts about Atheism. 

He is now participating in the Culture War against Gay and Trans people especially in schools or depictions in media. 

Dave is not the first prominent gay person to help far-right movements. The leader of the Brownshirts in Germany in the 1930s was an open gay man... It did not end well for Ersnt Rohm.

It seems Mark Wahlberg has partnered up with the Catholic Hallow App, which is a subscription service that has celebrities performing prayer among other things. Wahlberg now has is own segments on the app performing the rosary but also promoting his new movie.

Anti-SJWs INSANE MELTDOWN Over 'WOKE' She-Hulk - and Why they HATE the MCU for the WRONG Reasons,2022-09-01T03:00:18Z,PT46M43S,24971,1353,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Disney+’s She-Hulk TV series has been released to a pretty good reception. However, the existence of a female Hulk show was always going to drive certain conservatives crazy. Viral clips of She-Hulk lecturing Bruce about how hard it is for women to contain their anger have been shared widely to show that yes Disney-Marvel only creates shows to push leftist propaganda. 

However, just like always Conservatives miss the real issue with these Marvel properties. She-Hulk has also been widely criticised for having terrible CGI - which has become increasingly notable in the MCU since 2018’s Black Panther. This is due to the capitalist exploitation of VFX artists, constantly paid terribly and overworked on Marvel’s unrealistic timelines, Marvel’s exploitation is something that is truly worth of criticism. 

And what is this exploitation for? High art? The MCU has become increasingly stale with many of Western cinema’s most famous director’s coming out to criticise the MCU as soulless corporate garbage. The MCU has become just a way for Disney to make money. Even directors like Chloe Zhao are confined by this very limiting formula. 

We discuss all these issues in the video.

Starring Laurence Fox as Hunter, and Gina Carano as a Secret Service Agent, the trailer released last week to widespread excitement on Conservative media and also widespread mocking from everyone else. 

This movie looks like a bad rip off of Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street complete with 4th wall breaking narration from the main characters. Its the latest in a long line of Conservative Political Propaganda films which are reflective of Conservative inability to convey subtle political messaging.

Helping the Guardian break the Edward Snowden NSA leaks, to breaking corruption stories about Brazilian President Jair Bolsonoro, Greenwald accumulated an image of an anti-authoritrain activist - often putting himself in great danger especially in Brazil. 

Greenwald has always been a Libertarian free speech absolutist, believing even the most vile of political activists deserve to be heard. He built his legal career on defending these types in free speech cases. 

In recent years, Greenwald has cozied up to American Conservatism, frequently appearing on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show to endlessly agree with the Right-Wing hosts assessment on what is wrong in America. Glenn as no problem still defending some of America’s worst people and seemingly enjoy being a contrarian who annoys the people who used to admire him. Seemingly, his political activism in Brazil has also taken a right-wing turn as him and his partner turn against the Brazilian left including Lula.

Why The Far-Right LOVE Samurai and Feudal Japan (The Bushido Code and Yukio Mishima),2022-08-24T06:30:13Z,PT32M11S,19153,1020,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"The Japanese Samurai has become known throughout the world due to popular books, games and most famously films. Akira Kurosawa’s films often focusing on Ronin and Samurai became extremely popular and influential on global but in particular Western Cinema. Inspiring many Western films and even the Jedi in Star Wars, the Samurai took on mythical quality. Many were fed a sanitised version of these wealthy landowning soldiers as benevolent protectors of the downtrodden in Japan. 

As Japan industrialised and modernised during the Meiji Restoration, the Samurai essentially disappeared. Many became part of the new ruling elite, while others rebelled at the changing circumstances. Their Bushido Code became very influential in modern Japanese society including the military. 

After the US occupation, many in Japan looked back at its past and lamented its lost empire and loss of independence. Many looked back at the Meiji period, but many others, including famous author Yukio Mashima, looked back even further - to the Samurai dominated periods of Feudal Japan. Mashima was not alone on this, and his lamenting of the decline of the Samurai is something many in ultra-conservative circles still share.

Richard Spencer LOVES Vaush and Sam Seder!? How The Alt-Right Leader Is Pretending to be a Liberal,2022-08-20T06:15:01Z,PT33M21S,33269,1547,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Richard Spencer is one of America's most notorious Fascists along with David Duke and Nick Fuentes. The guy who coined the term Alt-Right has been rebranding in recent years after voting for Joe Biden over Donald Trump in 2020. 

Spencer has also been successfully sued for his role in the Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville in 2017, where he played a central role. 

On Twitter at least, Spencer's account is pretty much a generic American liberal. Supporting Joe Biden, criticising Donald Trump, promoting Ukraine in its fight against the invasion by Russia, while promoting his substack and podcast. 

However, recently he has gone on several panel shows where he has outlined his politics and it seems like he hasn't changed as much as he is pretending too. While saying he is a fan of The Majority Report and Vaush he still admits to subscribing to Race Realism while promoting 'White European Civilisation'. It more seems like the Alt-Right movement has evolved to pander to more reactionary young fascists rather than millennial fascists like Spencer. That and financial problems probably explain why he has seemingly changed his politics. 

In this video we analyse his supposed change and how it isn't too different from his old explicitly fascist days.

Tinder, Hinge and Bumble largely dominate the space. Many people put their political views and preferences in their bios. Both the right and left outline how they won’t date the other side. However, conservative men in particular seem to have been either the most hurt or outraged by this, believing they should be given a chance regardless of their political views. Politics don’t represent your own views and morals right!?

This has led to the Rise of Conservative exclusive dating apps. Most have gone out of business but there is a new one being launched next month. Backed by Peter Thiel and ran by former Trump Govt officials - the apps seeks to finally make a profitable app in this niche. Women automatically get free premium subscriptions lol.

The French peasant girl participated in Armagnac campaigns in the latter period of the Hundred Years War, rallying the troops as they fought the Burgundians and the English. She was eventually captured and condemned for multiple things, including wearing men’s clothes. Since then she has been adopted by multiple different political movements in France including the Resistance during WW2. However, she has also been a hugely popular figure with first the Vichy and later the Front National. 

Now Joan is stirring up more controversy as a Globe Theatre play ‘I, Joan’ will depict the saint as non-binary.  This has caused an uproar in the UK as people like JK Rowling believe it is deliberately erasing women’s history. 

In this video we discuss the legacy of Joan of Arc and how she has been adopted for multiple political causes throughout history.

Many of these people simply see women as objects. There fame has also created a whole host of others trying to get in on the action by promoting terrible life advice and creating books and courses for desperate men to read and maybe (probably won't) become more successful with the ladies tm. 

In this video we look at the industry around this, and how it is capitalising on a toxic view of the dating world and relationships.

‘You have to ADMIRE Hitler!’ - How Jordan Peterson Pushes INSANE Myths about Hitler and the Nazis,2022-08-12T07:40:00Z,PT42M51S,86989,4681,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Jordan Peterson feels like he is an authority on everything. Confident in talking about everything from psychology to international relations, Peterson has talked for hours at length for things that he doesn’t seem to fully understand. The rise of Hitler and the Nazis seems to be chief among them. Peterson tackled the Nazis from a psychological perspective, and ignores vast amounts of historical evidence that contradicts his conclusion that he has decided on knee jerk theories from often reading unreliable history books. 

From blaming atheism for the Nazis, to downplaying Hitler’s motives, Jordan Peterson has given inaccurate take after inaccurate take and has spoke far more positively on Hitler than any leader of Communist regimes.  


The article I read that destroys Peterson on this issue: https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/2020-07-03/ty-article-opinion/.highlight/jordan-petersons-barrage-of-revisionist-falsehoods-on-hitler-and-nazism/0000017f-e226-d804-ad7f-f3fe12900000?_amp=true

‘The Roman Legion was BASED!’ - Why The Far-Right SIMP For the Roman Empire,2022-08-11T05:00:30Z,PT35M8S,27766,1523,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"The ultra right have many favourite civilisations and empires in history. Previously, we have covered their love for ancient Greece and Sparta, the Vikings and the Anglo-Saxons. Today we are turning back to Europe’s biggest empire, the pagan and early Christian Roman Empire. 

Since its decline, many different groups have been fighting over the legacy of the Roman Empire. The Eastern Roman Empire had the strongest claim to its legacy until its defeat by the Ottoman Turks in 1453. Constantinople was founded by Rome’s first Christian Emperor Constantine as the new capital and remained the focal point of eastern Christendom for over one thousand years after the city was created. 

The Western Roman Empire slowly disintegrated into various fighting kingdoms. It was briefly unified under the Frank, Charlemagne, who claimed the title Holy Roman Emperor after being crowned by Pope Leo III in 800AD, calling himself Imperator Augustus in direct reference to the old Roman Empire. 

In more modern history, many countries have claimed the title of successor to the Roman Empire. The USA and 1930s Germany and Italy being two of the most notable. In the 21st century, many Western aligned nations view ancient Greece and Rome as the bedrock of Western Civilisation and helped create the best civilisation known to man: ‘The West’. 

In this video we discuss the history of Rome, its fall, and how it has loomed large over European history ever since.

‘GET WOKE POLITICS OUT OF STAR WARS!’ - Anti-SJWs Don’t Understand Star Wars has ALWAYS been WOKE,2022-08-06T05:35:01Z,PT31M,24168,1580,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"In a recent interview with Empire, an actor on the upcoming Disney+ Show about Rogue One character Cassian Andor, said the story will tackle the ‘Trumpian’ world. This explicit reference to former President Donald Trump set right-wing Anti-SJWs into a frenzy, declaring this was explicit proof that Disney were only using Star Wars to push leftist political messaging to Star Wars fans. Allegeding this is destroying the work of George Lucas. 

Another chapter in the story of Anti-SJWs not understanding their favourite franchises. Star Wars from its very inception was ‘woke’, with the Empire being inspired by the US due to its actions in Vietnam, Palpatine in the original trilogy being inspired by President Richard Nixon, with the Prequels version being inspired by Dick Cheney. Lucas has also regularly criticised capitalism in the film industry, praised the freedom that Soviet film directors had and criticised the US slide to authoritarianism under President Bush. George Lucas has never been one to hide away his political beliefs and that is obvious in his work - particularly the prequel trilogy.  

We discuss the politics of Lucas and Star Wars in response to the backlash.

The DOWNFALL And Trial of Alex Jones - and How Joe Rogan and Glenn Greenwald are PROMOTING Him,2022-08-05T06:13:00Z,PT37M38S,39337,1863,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Alex Jones has been in legal trouble for years after continuously promoting the Sandy Hook hoax on his Infowars online empire. On Thursday, he finally saw his day in court where a jury decided that he would have to pay $4.1 million in compensation to two parents of a child killed at Sandy Hook. Alex Jones’s fans have harassed the families of the deceased for ten years at this point. 

Jones is set to face even further legal action from the families, but that has not deterred his fans or affected his ability to generate revenue despite being banned off every single mainstream social media platform. It was revealed in the trial that he earned up to $800,000 a day from selling Infowars supplements, survival kits and merch. 

However some massively famous internet personalities still do not care what Jones has done. Joe Rogan has platformed Jones throughout his podcasting career and recently defended Alex Jones by saying that he gets alot right and is worth listening too. Last week, Glen Greenwald hosted a panel for a documentary about Jones where he spoke glowingly about his work, ignored Sandy Hook and painted him as a fellow fighter against the Western establishment.

Now that leaves the Subreddit divided. Peterson’s new fans are mostly US style conservatives focused on the culture war.

ANTI-SJWs MELTDOWN Over ‘WOKE’ GTA 6’s Female Protagonist: How GTA Has ALWAYS been Anti-Conservative,2022-07-29T07:45:00Z,PT33M32S,43102,2681,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Recent Bloomberg reports indicate that for the first time in a GTA game, in Grand Theft Auto 6, one of the playable main characters will be a woman. Also changes at the Rockstar workplace also indicate a focus on certain offensive jokes that featured in previous games. 

This caused Right-Wing gamers to meltdown and declare that GTA has now gone ‘woke’. This shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the franchise. GTA has always been anti-conservative, sometimes anti-capitalist, and a response to Conservative domination of America in the 21st century. This is most evident in the darker story of Nike Bellic in GTA IV. The game directly tackled the Bush era of American culture and politics.

Since then it has inspired wild conspiracy theories and often acts as a cover for fascists to gain political ground, as it did in Germany in the 1930s. 

Today Western anti-communists like to depict communism as one of the world’s worst ideologies while completely ignoring any and often all problematic and disastrous aspects of capitalism. 

The Victims of Communism Memorial Fund is one of the most notable organisations to spread falsehoods about communism, with its main source being The Black Book of Communism, a work by academic that grossly inflated death tolls in communist countries, often using dead fascist soldiers as part of their number of ‘victims’.

This often gets misrepresented as the person having leftist politics but in reality these celeb figures still want to maintain the capitalist status quo. And their belief in the status quo is why they will always side with The Right against the Left rather than join a side that shares more of their social values. 

This has manifested itself in three prominent celebrities - JK Rowling, Joe Rogan and Elon Musk. All three previously had a reputation for having fairly liberal politics to different extents.

How YouTubers EXPLOIT Poverty for VIRAL Videos (Fidias),2022-07-22T06:51:00Z,PT42M22S,29345,1661,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Mr Beast is one of the most successful and famous YouTubers on the platform. The owner of a YouTube empire, Mr Beast has various channels that rake in millions of views every week. His main channel focuses on competitions and stunts designed to go viral and garner as much attention as possible. His over-edited loud content has a massive appeal to younger audiences who will defend everything Beastie boy does. Mr Beast also has a charity channel and does massive philanthropic stunts to supposedly help save the environment - despite him being a massive shill for cryptocurrencies. 

I have been one of the few Youtubers (literally so brave) to criticise Mr Beast's content. Whether it be the excessive amounts of money he spends or more importantly Mr Beast using poverty and serious social issues as backdrops and playgrounds for his viral childish content. Whether that is touring a poor neighbourhood of a contestant winner or spending time in a prison with his friends. 

Unsurprisingly, the rise of Mr Beast has inspired multiple copycat channels. Recently, one that has gained some notoriety on social media has been Fidias. A Cypriot YouTuber, Fidias himself is obsessed with Mr Beast and went viral by saying his name 1 million times, before meeting Mr Beast on another video before actually featuring on a Mr Beast video - winning himself a $300k Lamborghini - he became just like Tye Lopez! 

However, not to be outdone by his inspiration, Fidias’s videos have become increasingly bizarre. While many of his videos are pretty standard viral challenges he has also exploited poverty as a backdrop for his content in a much more obvious way than Mr Beast. Advertising his trip to Burundi, the world’s poorest country, as if it were a viral Mr Beast challenge. 

In this video, I document the rise of Fidias, his relation to Mr Beast, and how his content evolves on the blueprint started by Mr Beast but taken to a even more off putting level.

In recent years, discussions around the depiction of women in gaming, manga, anime and movies in Japan have become common. 

One of the most notorious controversies around sexualised video games characters was Quiet in Metal Gear Solid V, but many anime characters have created conversations around how Japanese art sexualises certain characters. 

In this video we talk about the objectification of women in Japanese media and contrast it with American media.

The DOWNFALL of Jordan Peterson - And How His Subreddit TURNED ON HIM For Joining the Daily Wire,2022-07-16T06:35:00Z,PT37M6S,146874,6389,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Jordan Peterson has been one of the most prominent so-called intellectuals in Western politics. Bursting onto the scene railing against wokeness, he quickly became extremely wealthy through self-help book sales, podcasts and his own popular YouTube channel. Cutting a centrist image, his mainly male fan bases had a range of political beliefs. Peterson was seen as a calm rational debater who could successfully take on the left and the right with facts and logic. 

However, since 2017 he has been slowly pandering to an increasingly hard right audience before eventually joining Ben Shapiro’s Daily Wire this month. Due to the somewhat diverse nature of his fanbase many have turned against him quickly saying he has become the caricature the left always painted him as. 

In this video we go through his rise on social media and how he has gained a right-wing fan base while alienating his original fans.

'Chris Pratt is a Right-Wing PATRIOT!' - Why Conservatives Are SIMPING Over Chris Pratt,2022-07-15T05:50:00Z,PT32M1S,34204,1556,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Chris Pratt has recently been visibly upset at the pushback he gets on social media. The Marvel star has been confused at his general reception on social media where he has been dubbed the ‘Worst Chris’. A lot of this has been Chris Pratt’s own fault. He constantly posts about Christianity, the US military and the Police. He has also come out and blamed the Far Left for the state of US politics while advocating for a centrist style of politics to appeal to the masses. Recently, he has also taken a turn as a generic action star and is now featuring in the Tom Clancy knock off - The Terminal List, based on a book written by a right-wing former Navy Seal. 

However, this isn’t all Chris Pratt’s fault. It’s clear that Chris Pratt is not a fervent ideological Republican. But because of his right leaning tendencies he has been promoted heavily by Conservative media and social media. This has deepened his reputation as a staunch Republican which probably is not the reality. 

In this video we discuss the politics of Chris Pratt vs his public perception.

‘TAKE ME TO VALHALLA!’ - Why The Far-Right LOVE The Vikings and The Spartans,2022-07-13T04:00:03Z,PT35M19S,40998,2124,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"In the Western imagination, the Ancient Spartans and the Vikings are seen as the pinnacle of warrior culture. Of course, the militaries of these societies have also attracted the attention and affection of nationalist and ultra-Conservative groups who appropriate their history’s for their own agenda. 

Western civilisation at large as idealises the Spartans, particularly the famous Battle of Thermopylae where 300 Spartans (with their Thebian allies) stood against the Persian forces. Their later alliance with the Persians against Athens is largely ignored, and instead they are remembered for this one battle - that they actually lost. In reality, the Spartans were not uniquely highly regarded for their military tactics compared to the other Greek states. But their militaristic authoritarian monarchy was fairly unique for the region. 

In terms of the Vikings, they had already been cemented in the Christian histories of Europe has they constantly attacked monasteries and vulnerable cities and later won pitched battles against English armies to capture much of England itself. However, later they would be looked upon fondly by the Germans of the 1930s who believe they shared a common generic and warrior heritage. In modern times, the Norse religion itself has been appropriated. 

In the video we discuss both these groups and how their history has been distorted to fit a certain political agenda.

WTF!?

The killing of one of Japan’s most famous Prime Ministers sent shockwaves around the world. The motive of the Assassin still remains obscure and due to him wearing a face covering people were speculating who the man who did the hit actually was. 

On 4Chan a troll post said the real identity of the killer was Samyuera Hydeo (referencing Sam Hyde) and used pictures of Kojima. This was expanded upon by more trolls on twitter who took pictures of Kojima around left wing symbols to try and paint the attack as something carried out by leftists. This was then spread by ultra-conservative European politicians before being reported on by Iranian and Greek news media who not only used the pictures as a stand-in for the assassin but even said this proved he had a fascination with Che Guevara.

However, in America, the belief that many are direct descendants from the Anglo-Saxons is very popular. Many believe America was founded on Anglo-Saxon political and religious traditions and the Founding Fathers created the USA as a true successor to Anglo-Saxon England. Thomas Jefferson being one of the most prominent Founding Fathers pushing this. 

Often ignored by American historians, the role of Anglo-Saxon history in founding America is only rivalled by Greek and Roman history. However, starting in the 16th century, and gaining massive prominence in the 1800s, Britain and America created a racial identity of ‘Anglo-Saxon’. While it has massively decreased in the UK towards irrelevance, it is still common enough in America Marjorie Taylor Greene and certain members of the GOP tried to create a caucus last year based on supposed Anglo-Saxon political traditions.

A couple years back this included Sonic The Hedgehog after the movie outperformed DC’s Birds of Prey. They tried to create a narrative of a leftist film being received poorly while Sonic was a non-political movie made for the fans which made it successful. 

This type of narrative has been created again with Minions 2: The Rise of Gru vs Disney Pixar's Lightyear. Lightyear has been criticised for being ‘too woke’ while Minions 2 has been lauded for being a fun film for all the family… Or so it would seem.

However, most of the pundits are older men who do not appear to be in touch with pop culture. Anti-SJW nerd channels like The Quartering and Geeks + Gamers do very well in covering pop culture from a conservative point of view. 

Recently the Daily Wire has been dabbling in gaming content but it mostly feels inauthentic and an attempt to pander. It seems they have enlisted Quartering and Geeks + Gamers to collab on certain videos to both cross pollinate their audience and try and spread conservative videos to gamers and Anti-SJWs at large.

The RACISM Of Anime and Weeaboos - and Why Black Fans and Creators are FIGHTING BACK,2022-06-29T06:11:01Z,PT29M5S,53101,3129,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Manga and Anime are one of Japan's biggest cultural exports. Become very popular in the West in the 1990s - Dragon Ball, Cowboy Bebop, Pokemon and others became staples of entertainment in the West. I myself grew up on Pokemon, Yugi-Oh, Beyblade and Digimon. 

However, Anime has historically had a problem with the depiction of black characters. Either important stereotypes and caricatures that influenced the designs of Mr Popo and Jynx or having black character act in a way which often made them seem silly and the butt of the joke. 

This lack of sensitivity to race has translated into the anime communities at large with several black anime cosplayers getting backlash for their version of famous characters. 

However, there is hope. Yasuke, a recent Netflix anime, focused on a famous historical black samurai in feudal Japan created by black director and starring a black actor. Naomi Osaka recently has also got her own manga which has increased the discussion in Japan itself on how to represent non-Japanese and non-white characters with respect.

'Lightyear is WOKE GARBAGE!' - Anti-SJWs attack Lightyear for Diversity while SIMPING for TOP GUN,2022-06-24T05:40:00Z,PT26M30S,22885,1168,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"A new battle in the Conservative Culture war has emerged. A battle between apolitical pro-American Top Gun Maverick and the woke Disney Pixar movie Lightyear.

Reminiscent of the battle between Sonic the Hedgehog and DC’s ‘woke’ Birds of Prey, Conservative say that the success of Top Gun is due to its unapologetic glorification of the US Navy while Lightyear’s diversity has alienated the Toy Story faithful fans. 

Of course both movies have many reasons why they were successful and unsuccessful that has little to do with politics and both films pretty much target a different audience - but that hasn’t stop reactionary conservatives creating this fictional battle between the two. 

In the video we discuss how Conservatives actually love politics in their films as long as it caters and panders to them.

Named after its founder Dennis Prager, the organisation collaborates with the most well known American conservative media pundits to push their agenda. 

Recently like many other conservative outlets, they are marketing their content towards younger people. In this video we look at the channel’s content style and speculate on why it is being massively astroturfed and boosted by PragerU’s own marketing team instead of seeing organic growth.

For years, many people loved his roasts of other YouTubers like Jake Paul, RiceGum, Keemstar among others. His videos - including the Content Cop series - relied on shock humour in terms of his language and often potentially offensive sketches that he did. 

This led to him having a deeply reactionary fanbase. So in 2020, after things were made public about his girlfriend, a large segment of his fanbase turned on him. This was a big moment for iDubbbz who slowly abandoned his edgelord persona due to it creating a toxic fanbase.

NETFLIX IS MAKING IRL SQUID GAME! How Anti-SJWs and Corporations RUIN Anti-Capitalist Media,2022-06-17T05:37:00Z,PT33M6S,16087,1004,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Squid Game was one of 2021’s most successful shows. Gaining global acclaim and viewership, the South Korean dystopian show focuses on the lives of contestants in a warped game show where contestants all compete for the prize money. Much of the show is inspired by Hwang Dong-Hyuk’s own life experience in career, including his accumulation of debt which is a massive problem in Korea at large. 

In no uncertain terms - Hwang has said that Squid Game is both about capitalism and anti-capitalist. However, almost immediately people would say that the show was actually about anti-communism and Mr Beast even made his own IRL Squid Game - obviously without any of the social commentary. 

This is a trend with anti-capitalist media. Squid Game, The Matrix, American Psycho and others all critique our economic system but often end up being either ruined or appropriated by right-wingers and corporations.

How The Last of Us Part II is ACTUALLY About the Israel-Palestine Conflict (Neil Druckmann and Gaza),2022-06-16T03:02:00Z,PT37M50S,22190,1145,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"The Last of Us Part II is one of the most critically acclaimed games of all time. Developed by Naughty Dog, the divisive sequel to The Last of Us was Directed and Co-Written by Neil Druckmann. Druckmann was born and raised in Israeli occupied West Bank and has spoken briefly about how both games are actually influenced by Israeli politics and the conflict between Israel and Palestine. 

This is most apparent in the second game. The conflict between the Washington Liberation Front (WLF) and the Seraphite tribe has much resemblance to Israel’s history and present hostility to the surrounding region. While not an explicit commentary on the conflict it is hard to detach Druckmann’s views and upbringing from the politics of the game which I discuss in the video.

Starring Kamala Khan, the show and comic depict a teenage girl navigating her life which includes a depiction of Muslim and Pakistani-American life in New York. It marked the first time Marvel had an explicit Muslim as a leading character. 

After multiple comics, and starring in the Avengers video game, she has finally got her own show. However, it has not gone down well with fans. First it suffered a brigade of negative reviews on IMDB making it the worst reviewed MCU show on that site. But it does not seem to reflect the shows quality. 

Anti-SJWs have also complained. Saying the downvotes are legit and also Ms Marvel has no mass appeal due to its focus on a Pakistani Muslim American. Of course, no such criticism has ever been levelled at DareDevil, showing an Irish-American Catholic character who wrestles with his faith and even has a mother who is a nun.

Matthew McConaughey LOVES Jordan Peterson!? And Why He has Anti-Leftist Centrist Politics,2022-06-10T06:37:00Z,PT38M54S,20242,1122,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Matthew McConaughey has been one of Hollywood’s most successful actors over the last decade. McConaughey had gained a reputation in the 2000’s for starring in average run of the mill romantic comedies. However, the early 2010s became known as the McConaissance due to his excellent performances in Mud, Magic Mike, Dallas Buyers Club, The Wolf of Wall Street, True Detective and Interstellar. This streak earned him widespread acclaim and an Oscar for best actor. While not being able to reclaim the heights of the 2012-2014 period, McConaughey has become one of Hollywood’s most charismatic and popular stars. 

In 2021, He announced he was looking into running for the Governor of Texas. This meant he was interviewed on his political views for the first time in a major way. He positioned himself as an aggressive centrist, saying he believed in both right wing and left wing policies. He described his centrist politics as radical in a time of deep polarisation in the US. 

However, his centrist politics do not really hold up to much scrutiny, and McConaughey mainly comes across as a man seeking to hold office and remain popular rather than assume office to enact an agenda that may be unpopular with some.

However, many of the founding members of the Israel state where in fact atheists themselves. Due to the War on Terror melting New Atheist brains, many New Atheist like Israel as a symbol of the progressive west in a sea of 'backwards' Middle Eastern Islamic nations. This extends to Palestine and the Gaza strip. To people like Sam Harris, Palestinians haven't been radicalise by decades of brutal occupation but simply because they are Muslims. 

Israel plays into this heavily. Many Israeli tourism adverts focus on its LGBT scene, particularly in Tel Aviv. This is often cynically weaponised against progressive groups who support LGBT rights as well as the Palestinian struggle.

Beginning with Jake Lloyd and Ahmed Best after the Phantom Menace, the modern fan bases has also taken a dislike to Kellie Marie Tran, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and now Moses Ingram. It’s probably not a huge surprises that most of these people are not white dudes. 

Moses Ingram plays the character of Reva in the new Obi-Wan Kenobi Disney+ show and has seen many criticise her performance leading to disgusting messages being sent to her on Instagram. Both the Star Wars Twitter account and Ewan McGregor showed their support for her on social media which led to even further backlash of Disney supposedly attacking ‘the fans.’

However, what I want to focus on today is the social media reaction to the trial. A case that covered serious subject matter was made into a circus with thousands of creators making meme videos or streaming every second of the trial.

The Witcher has become one of the biggest fantasy properties over the last decade. The Witcher 3 propelled the series into the global mainstream but the books and games have always been very popular in the West. 

Written by a Polish author and including many references to Polish history and folklore, many people have been sensitive about changes that have been carried out primarily in the Netflix show and often focusing on the diverse casting choices. 

The Far-Right have often adopted the world of the Witcher due to the game depicting a primarily white Central European inspired world. However, upon closer inspection it’s hard to reconcile nationalists views of The Witcher with the actual messages of the game.

All three have been propped up by Conservative media for their takes on the US left and their anti-woke takes and jokes. Many have received millions of new right-wing fans over the last two years despite insisting they are still the same old liberals/leftists they have always been. 

In the video we look at these three figures and look at what kind of takes has made them so appealing to modern US conservatives.

How Ricky Gervais Became a Conservative HERO for His Anti-Trans 'Jokes' (Netflix Special),2022-05-27T05:03:00Z,PT32M24S,49494,2793,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Ricky Gervais is probably Britain's most famous comedian. Rising to fame with The Office, where he played David Brent, with his lauded performance spawning a moderately successful Hollywood career as well as writing and starring in his own acclaimed TV series and standup shows. 

Gervais has always been outspoken, become well known for his views on religion and his advocacy for atheism. However, in recent years he has become notorious for his transgender jokes. These usually are the most unfunny attempts at humour. In clips surfaced from his recent Netflix special, he has told even more transgender jokes to the delight of TERFS and American conservatives. 

In recent years Gervais has slowly been getting more and more right-wing fans. Unlike some others, I don't believe Gervais is actively seeking these fans or grifting to get them - but his views on things like Trans people are being used by the right as part of this culture war. 

In the video we talk about the backlash to his recent special and Gervais's politics.

Countless YouTube videos covering the case have received millions of views while on TikTok memes and jokes about Amber Heard have been circulating. The online ecosystem has very much decided that they are team Johnny Depp. 

However, many of these people have ignored very concrete evidence against Johnny Depp in favour of less solid evidence that paints Depp in a far more favourable light. Social media have firmly made up their mind on his innocence.

A more sinister element have taken this even further and are using the case to discredit all women who come forward against powerful men - saying it is feminism run amok.

The DOWNFALL of Joe Rogan - And Why his Subreddit TURNED ON HIM For Becoming a Conservative BOOMER,2022-05-21T05:50:00Z,PT35M20S,80092,3977,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Joe Rogan has created a podcasting empire. Becoming insanely popular on YouTube and podcasting sites, Rogan signed a multimillion dollars exclusivity deal with Spotify. But since then Rogan has increasingly slid into right-wing views alienating many of his fans.

While Rogan always platformed people from across the political spectrum, there was a view that he at least tried to have honest conversations and seek some sort of balance on his platform although this usually resulted in far more conservatives going on the Podcast then Leftists. He interviewed the likes of Kyle Kulinski, Cenk Uyger, Ana Kasparian, David Pakman as well as Lefty politicians like Bernie Sanders and academics like Cornell West. 

However, for Rogan's stance on a number of issues, he has become a conservative hero and has increasingly indulged a whole host of conspiracy theories - essentially becoming no better than a right-wing boomer obsessed with Facebook memes. 

While his fans are not the most left-leaning bunch, Rogan's obvious shift rightwards has alienated many of his fans on his subreddit who now constantly call him out.

The article outlined how engaging with politics separated it from its roots. The internet quickly piled onto the tweet to let Fox know the obvious - Star Trek has always been a pretty progressive show since its inception and has always spoken about political issues. 

In this video we look at the article and the general backlash against modern Star Trek from conservatives before looking into the franchise's political history before asking the question of why do culture warriors love left wing sci-fi which they don’t actually realise is ‘woke’.

If you are familiar with 4Chan alt-right BS nothing in it will surprise you. But there was on part on East Asians where the killer outlined his respect for Japanese, Chinese and Korean people and saw them as potential allies. 

While this may be surprising to those unfamiliar with the specifics of white supremacy, this has been a long through line in Nazi ideology. Hitler admired both the Chinese and Japanese too - and had alliances with both Chiang Kaishek and later the fascist empire of Japan. Dylan Roof, another murder, also outline his admiration for East Asians.

But why do people who believe in a murderous ideology based on the superiority of the 'white race' either tolerate or actively like East Asians? There are multiple reasons. From the fascist anti-communist Kaisheck and Tojo to the model minority myth and racist stereotypes of Asian women - many reasons lead these racists to believe that Asians will be compatible in their future ethnostate.

However, her leftist viewpoints have clashed with both the mainstream Hollywood liberal elite and the Democratic Party. Since 2016, she has become a conveniant scape goat for liberals due to her vote in the 2016 election. 

Sarandon campaigned for Bernie Sanders and endorsed Green Party Candidate Jill Stein instead of Hillary Clinton. When Donald Trump won, the Centrist Democrat's anger did not turn on the Clinton campaign but 'saboteurs' like Susan Sarandon.

He has been a constant presence on late night tv for over a decade and a half. Maher has always been outspoken, a prominent atheist who would go after the religious right. Maher was also a massive critic of the Bush administration and the war in Iraq gaining him credibility as a respectable liberal. 

However, in 2014 Maher turn his criticism away from the religious right in the US to the Muslim world. Delcaring Islam a barbaric set of ideas that makes its followers inherently violent, Maher fully embraced New Atheist critiques of the Muslim world steeped in Western Chauvinism. 

Bill has decried the Left leaving him behind, but even Maher's supposed liberal beliefs must come into question. Last year, he supported the brutal Israeli attack on Gaza and recently said that Florida's 'Don't Say Gay' Bill made sense.

"'NANOMACHINES, SON' - How Metal Gear Rising's POLITICS and MEMES Made it INSANELY Popular Again",2022-05-06T05:40:01Z,PT30M58S,14331,1089,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Metal Gear Rising released to a pretty solid reception back in 2013. One of the few games in the series developed outside of Kojima production, Platinum Games developed a hack and slash romp through 2018 America which saw you confront eccentric villains. The game was a sequel to MGS4 and followed many themes of MGS2 as the player once again played as Raiden. 

The game fell of the raider for many years as MGSV released in 2015 to widespread critical acclaim placing Rising firmly in its shadow. However, over the last year, Rising has seen an insane increase in popularity. Gameplay videos garner millions of views and covers of the iconic soundtrack are released to a similarly large audience. 

But why has Rising seen such a huge comeback? Well, memes. Senator Armstrong has become the face of many memes that have been going viral on the internet. Which fits in nicely to the themes of Metal Gear Rising and MGS2 which both focus on Richard Dawkins The Selfish Gene - which popularised the term meme.

The US Right-Wing have claimed Musk over the last two years as he panders to their political beliefs. Recently, he has been exclusively tweeting about the 'far-left' and how they have alienated America by shifting the political spectrum.

'The Northman is BASED' - Why the Far-Right LOVE Vikings and DEBUNKING Viking History MYTHS,2022-04-30T05:05:00Z,PT25M42S,81622,3161,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Robert Eggers The Northman recently released to pretty positive review of its brutal depiction of medieval Scandinavian life. He vowed with his film to take Viking history away from conservatives with many saying he has failed. 

Many conservatives love the film as it glorifies a time period they so dearly love. But it begs the question, why does the Right wing obsess so much with the Scandinavian raiders and settlers form the 700s and beyond?  

In this video we look at what makes Viking culture and history so appealing to everyone and why it has been co-opted by the right and has historically been dating back to early 1900s Germany.

P*RNHUB's FAKE WOKENESS and How it Uses Charity to MASK its Predatory Exploitation,2022-04-28T05:30:06Z,PT28M2S,23616,1261,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"The adult film industry is one of the most popular things on the internet. It rakes in millions of dollars every single year, but is also filled with abuse, criminality and exploitation. 

MindGeek, the owner of PrnHub among multiple other popular sites, has built its fortune and reputation on alleged platforming of criminal content that has fallen through its moderation system. Many adult actors have claimed its monopoly is bad for the industry. 

However, Hub itself also presents itself as a very 'woke' company, doing various campaigns for the environment and giving away money to various causes. Yet imo, this is just to sanitise its exploitation and make its image more palatable to the online masses.

This has mainly taken the form of them criticising supposed 'Mary Sue' characters like Rey in Star Wars who have simply been created to push some form of progressive agenda.

However, this recently has been taken to a new level because of the depiction of female characters with visibly large muscles. Most recently they have criticising Natalie Portman who has trained with a personal trainer to get in shape for the upcoming Thor movie where she will play a female version of the character. 

However this is nothing new. Last year, Encanto faced a similar backlash for its character Luisa and in 2020, The Last of Us Part II faced a wave of criticism for its depiction of Abby - the muscular lead character in the game who was called 'unrealistic.' 

In this video we discuss these three cases and why Anti-SJWs do not like strong women.

'TURNING RED IS TRASH FOR NOT SHOWING 9/11' - The INSANE Anti-SJW Criticisms of Disney's Turning Red,2022-04-22T05:02:00Z,PT26M24S,44292,2077,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Turning Red is Disney Pixar's latest film that has been received with widespread acclaim and general audience enjoyment. However, there has been a pushback by conservatives. The film deals with a coming of age story that covers topics like puberty, periods and sneaking out to concerts behind your parents back. Many right-wing parents were uncomfortable with the subject matter and believed it promoted undesirable morals in kids. This took a more sinister tone as Conservatives are using their campaign against Disney as a trojan horse to attack LGBT rights. 

Then - Enter YouTuber: Mr Enter. This YouTube video Essayist chimed in with his own criticism of the movie. Among his complaints about story and unlikeable characters, he also criticised the film's authenticity to the year it was set in - 2002. His complaints ranged from the music and consumer goods on show... to the movie not sufficiently dealing with the impact of 9/11 on Western society... As we all know, any good kids movie deals with the impact of 9/11. 

In the video, we respond to Enter's review and document how Turning Red got caught up in the Culture War

'Crypto will Create COMMUNISM!' - The WEIRD Politics of Grimes and Her Abandoning The Left,2022-04-21T04:38:00Z,PT28M52S,21375,1162,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"As part of the rise of her career, Grimes cultivated a left leaning anti-establishment edgy personality. Being part of outcast groups as a teen, she described her self as a leftist, even going as far to try and live in communities without currency. 

However, she shocked her loyal fanbase when it was revealed she was dating Elon Musk. For many, dating a billionaire is kinda incompatible with supposed left-wing political ideals. 

Yet, if you listen to many of Grimes's pondering about AI, Gaming and Communism, you will see someone completely obsessed with AI and Science Fiction who may use this passion to justify her often inconsistent political beliefs. 

In this video we look at media that came out mostly in 2022 where she spoke about her politics including a large profile in Vanity Fair and a Twitch stream collab with Hasan.

How Mr Beast’s Content Grossly EXPLOITS POVERTY and Why Millionaire Charity Doesn’t Work,2022-04-19T04:25:01Z,PT43M10S,24956,1349,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Mr Beast is beloved on YouTube for his extravagant and expensive videos that often involve him spending thousands of dollars during the video. Mr Beast is also known for his generosity, giving the ‘less fortunate’ money and he even has his own food banks and whole channel dedicated to doing charity work. To most people Mr Beast is above and beyond criticism. 

However, no one is safe from a good old fashion cancelling from me. But Mr Beast has many fans. I had to enlist some help, and in this video Twitch Streamer AmyeC3 helps me analyse why Mr Beast’s charity content is so exploitative and also the problems with non-profits that seem so generous on the surface but in reality are a bit more sinister. 

We also discuss the huge failure of Brad Pitt’s housing project in New Orleans.

‘OK Groomer!’ - Anti-SJWs Use Their SINISTER War Against ‘WOKE’ Disney to ATTACK The LGBT Community,2022-04-16T05:27:01Z,PT31M22S,33632,1723,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Anti-SJWs hating Disney for its supposed woke politics is something that has been common since the release of The Last Jedi in 2017. It propelled Anti-SJW nerd channels to immense popularity and helped popularise the phrase ‘go woke go broke’. 

However, lately this has taken a very sinister turn. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has recently passed a bill that would prohibit teaching young people about the LGBT community while also allowing schools to out students who have come out at school but not to their own families due to a fear of being ostracised. 

Disney originally vowed not to get involved in this political issue, in the state that has their largest theme park. However, after protests against Disney by the public and Disney employees, the company pledged to support LGBT and their allies and make more content catered to younger LGBT. This has infuriated American conservatives who have alleged that US schools and Disney are brainwashing kids with a ‘LGBT gender identity’ ideology which is preying on children.  

In this video we discuss the sinister new campaign by right-wing nerd and traditional media and how this is creating a more dangerous environment for the LGBT community.

The Leftist Politics of Hideo Kojima and Hayao Miyazaki and Why They DONT Like America,2022-04-14T05:23:00Z,PT35M21S,53779,2874,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Hideo Kojima and Hayao Miyazaki are both world famous Japanese auteur directors in very different mediums. Kojima is one of the world’s most famous video game directors, achieving fame through his decades long spanning franchise Metal Gear Solid. Miyazaki is also world famous for his animated films that have also won academy awards. 

While not too similar on the surface, Kojima and Miyazaki do share many similarities particularly in the realm of politics and how their own ideologies manifest themselves in their creations. Both have a general aversion to war, both have critique both American cultural and physical imperialism and have consistently used their works to criticise the West. 

However, there is some nuance here. Miyazaki was born in 1941 and saw Japan swiftly transition from a more traditional society to one heavily influenced by the USA - leaving a lifelong aversion to US culture. Kojima, born in the 1960s, was raised in a more Western facing Japan and as a result does not share Miyazaki’s views on how bad the US influence was for Japan.

In this video, I discuss the politics of both men, and delve deeper into the message of Metal Gear Solid V to highlight Kojima’s politics.

He has become a darling of conservative and libertarian media despite the fact he still hilariously claims he is not a conservative. 

Over the last year and a half Jordan Peterson has also been promoting Bitcoin, culminating in him giving a talk at the largest in person Bitcoin convention last week in Miami. The Bitcoin community have had a mixed response to Peterson, with many true believers in the Bitcoin ideology not thinking he actually cares about Cryptocurrency. However, many in Crypto media welcome him with open arms because there is a massive crossover with those who love Bitcoin and those who watch Joe Rogan-adjacent media like Peterson, Lex Fridman and others.

The CRAZY Cult of Jared Leto: His LEGIONS of Fanatical Fans + INSANE Method Acting for Morbius/Joker,2022-04-09T04:35:01Z,PT27M48S,60509,2674,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Jared Leto has been around in Hollywood for over two decades. Working on some amazing films and even winning an Oscar for best supporting actor, Leto has established himself in the world of cinema and has many fans. In addition to his successful acting career, 50 year old Leto is also a successful rock star with his band 30SecondsToMars. The band primarily has given Leto a devoted and zealous fanbase. 

Leto has largely avoided controversy, but faces a slew of allegations and also some very bizarre acting practices that he utilises as part of his method acting.  In this video we delve into his fandom and talk about his controversies.

‘MCU IS PROPAGANDA!’ Turkish Marvel Fans MELTDOWN Over Moon Knight Acknowledging Armenian Genocide,2022-04-07T02:30:09Z,PT38M3S,26531,1398,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Moon Knight released at the end of March. The latest series streaming on Disney+ stars Oscar Isaac, and while only the start of the series has been shown it has generally received positive reviews. However, there are a contingent of Marvel fans who absolutely hate the new show and that is Turkish fans. 

In just ONE SCENE, Ethan Hawkes character mentioned the Armenian Genocide to Oscar Isaac's briefly. However, this was enough for Turkish fans to review bomb the show calling it political propaganda and Marvel was trying to make Turks look bad. 

This is a symptom of a wider fight over the Armenian Genocide. Last year, Joe Biden finally recognised it after decades of US Presidents in both parties promising they would. But many countries do not recognise it, including Israel and the UK and also Turkey itself. 

The Genocide took place between 1915-1917, with the majority of prominent historians acknowledging it was a genocide. The massacres of Armenians continued after the end of the First World War during the Greco-Turk War of 1919-1921 as well as the Turkish War of Independence. Turkey has long downplayed the genocide calling it a massacre that was justified due to Ottoman and Turkish fears that Armenians would act as Greek and Russian proxies in a potential uprising which was both unlikely and never came to pass. As it is part of the founding of the Turkish Republic there is little appetite in the nation to describe their founder fathers as mass murderers. 

In this video we discuss the reaction to Moon Knight, talk about Oscar Isaac's film on the Genocide 'The Promise' which came out during the same time as a Turkish backed film on the same event called 'The Ottoman Lieutenant', and talk about the geopolitics behind countries recognising the brutality of what happened to the Armenians.

Why JK Rowling is ATTACKING Leftist YouTubers like Vaush and The Humanist Report (BreadTube),2022-04-05T04:36:00Z,PT29M46S,38087,2214,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"JK Rowling has been mired in controversy over the last two years for her political views. After enjoying the support of Ben Shapiro and Donald Trump Jr for her views on the LGBT community, she has also recently gone after Leftist YouTubers. 

In early March, a controversial joke by YouTuber and streamer Vaush was picked up by JK Rowling and was covered by mainstream news. On Saturday, JK Rowling called out prominent Leftist Mike from the Humanist Report for attacking her political views. 

Vaush and others believe that the reason JK Rowling calls out him and the Left is because in reality she does not actually care about women's rights. However, in the context of UK politics - Rowling is a pretty standard liberal. 

In this video, we discuss why conservatives love JK Rowling, why Vaush missed the context of her political views and why Rowling was ridiculous to go after Mike.

The BIGGEST SIMPS for Elon Musk and Gary Vee! How LinkedIn Became a Narcissistic CULT of Capitalism,2022-04-02T02:00:05Z,PT41M47S,21858,1311,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"If you have ever applied for a job online then there is a pretty decent chance you have a LinkedIn profile. The social media site is used by many employees to network across different industries as well as apply for jobs and share their best work as well as the occasional ‘funny’ post…

However, it seems in recent years that LinkedIn has transitioned into something new. No longer primarily used for the job hunt, people now use LinkedIn as traditional social media - the problem being your profile is tied to your current job and could affect your future prospects - so the honesty in many LinkedIn posts seems to be lacking. 

Instead we get - endless self promotion and worship of corporate capitalist culture. 

In this video we dive into the insanity of LinkedIn in 2022.

KONY 2012 - 10 YEARS LATER: The CRAZY Viral Social Media Campaign Fuelled by White Saviour Syndrome,2022-03-31T02:30:22Z,PT31M49S,20000,1044,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"In March 2012, the first viral social media campaign of its kind was launched by the NGO Invisible Children. It focused on Ugandan Christian Warlord Joseph Kony who had long been chased by the Ugandan and US government for his widespread and brutal crimes he had inflicted on people across various African nations. 

On the surface the social media campaign made it seem simple. Joseph Kony was bad, Ugandan and Sudanese military was good. Buy Invisible Children Kony merch to help the hunt for this warlord and finally bring him to justice. This made the campaign extremely palatable to people as it seemed completely moral unambiguous. 

However, the charity quickly drew criticism as well as praise. Ugandan's and Africans criticised the White Saviour aspects of the campaign while human rights groups pointed out that the Ugandan military also had a terrible record of human rights abuses. There also wasn't much clarity on where the money was exactly going nor who was astroturfing the campaign. It turns out far-right Evangelicals had helped astroturf Invisible Children as they had long been involved in Uganda. This stress eventually led to Jason Russell - the face of the campaign - having a mental breakdown on the streets of LA. 

In this video, we discuss the legacy of Kony 2012 and how it influenced modern social media activism while also critiqing it from a 2022 perspective.

The INSANE DOWNFALL of Justin Bieber and Chris Pratt's FAVOURITE Church - Hillsong and Carl Lentz,2022-03-29T04:43:01Z,PT37M12S,27911,1727,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Hillsong Church has become insanely popular since the original Australian franchise moved to the US, setting up popular locations in LA and NYC. The Church is attended by the rich and famous included Justin Bieber and Chris Pratt. Bieber himself has a very close relation to the church. Hipster Pastor Carl Lentz took Bieber in and eventually baptised him into the church. 

However, the celebrity endorsements can only cover the image of the church for so long. Hillsong has been rocked by numerous scandals involving its leading figures and Carl Lentz himself was forced to leave the church in disgrace. A recent Discovery+ documentary released this month has taken a deeper look into the church and found a place that - like many organised religions - is rife with scandal.

The ENDLESS Anti-SJW Hate Campaign Against Brie Larson - Grifters Keep Creating Outrage for Content,2022-03-26T06:13:00Z,PT27M33S,32876,1909,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Brie Larson is a best known for playing Captain Marvel in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. She has also bizarrely become one of the most controversial actresses in Hollywood due to being targetted by MCU fan communities online. This originally stemmed from a speech she gave asking for more inclusiveness in film critic circles. 

From this, the campaign against her gained momentum until every little thing she did online was being scrutinised. This resulted in her recently launched YouTube channel being brigaded by these fans who were all ridiculing her in the comments section of her videos. 

Brie has said social media has been bad for her mental health and she now does not handle her own accounts. Its not hard to see why. 

Even 4 years later, Brie Larson is a popular figure to attack online for these communities. The curious thing is, these same people did not have much to say for Brie promoting NFTs and the metaverse - which her loyal fans did criticise her for - but they were annoyed that Brie seemingly made a joke at Shirley Temple's expense. 

In this video, we discuss the reactionary movement against her and how it is a desperate but successful attempt to create traffic for these Anti-SJW youtube channels.

But that is exactly what is happening right now with JK Rowling. 

The Harry Potter author has gained widespread notoriety for her campaign against the modern Trans Rights movement under the guise of wanting to protect 'women' from what she sees as a movement that will enable predators. She has been strongly praised by Conservatives and Rowling herself has constantly retweeted misinformation and offered her support to hard right figures. 

In this video we look at her recent controversy and how she is embracing this far-right support in her anti-trans rights crusade. We also discuss why so many supposed liberal feminists in Britain are so hostile to trans rights.

Rubin has been a rising star in conservative media after he announced a few years ago that he was no longer a 'Classical Liberal' and was actually just a conservative. 

Since then he has worked closely with the Fox News crew and has regularly collaborated with Glen Beck's The Blaze. Dave has outlined how he believes conservatives to actually be the most tolerant group of people - if Rubin actually believed this - him announcing his parenthood to the world ensured he was in for a shock. 

While many of his buddies in the media congratulated the announcement, most of the general audience reaction was extremely negative with many of them also turning on the Blaze and PragerU for congratulating Rubin. 

In this video we discuss the recent drama, Rubin's grift and how the Right will always used grifters like him but never actually accept him.

Anti-SJW Elden Ring Fans MELTDOWN After Black Fans Call Game OUT for Lack of Diversity + Hairstyles,2022-03-18T06:12:01Z,PT31M51S,29237,1654,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Elden Ring has released to amazing critical and commercial success. The newest entry builds on its Dark/Demon Souls heritage and introduces a Zelda like open world that is absolutely huge. Part of the games appeal is the numerous ways you can create varied builds to tackle the games challenges.

Like Souls games before it, Elden Ring also features a pretty extensive character creator. However, Black Elden Ring fans have noticed that there is only one Afro style hairstyle for black players to make a character based on their likeness while there are numerous for other players. An article in the Verge laid out these criticisms leading to sensitive Elden Ring fans to meltdown. 

The most bizarre defence of the omission of black hairstyles is that including them would not be historically accurate. Elden Ring is a game where European Medieval Knights and Japanese style Samurai fight giant lobsters and roaming bandit apes...

"Gal Gadot, Imagine and The RISE of Performative ‘Main Character’ Celebrity Political Activism",2022-03-16T05:31:00Z,PT34M45S,22339,1450,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Social media has been a great tool in promoting activist causes around the world and has seen increased use over the last 2 years in educating people on controversial issues. It had also seen the rise of celebrities taking to social media to talk about causes important to them. 

However, this often translates to cringeworthy performative activism. Most infamously was a bunch of celebrities led by Gal Gadot in singing John Lennon's Imagine. This was met with widespread criticism from all sides. 

This was followed up by Aaron Paul and another crew of celebrities filming another cringey pledge by finally and most recently AnnaLyne McCord recorded herself reciting a bizarre poem. 

In this video, we discuss performative activism which traces its modern roots back to BandAid and LiveAid in the 1980s, while also looking at better celebrity activists like Marlon Brando.

The Right-Wing GRIFT Of Russell Brand - How He ABANDONED Leftism to be the Next Joe Rogan (Part 2),2022-03-12T05:50:00Z,PT51M25S,56941,2634,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"This is the second part of a two part video series I’ve done on Russell Brand. In the first we covered the origins of his politics on his YouTube channel and how he has shifted political positions on certain issues. 

In this video, we discuss Brand’s economic views which often veered into class reductionist territory which paved the way for him pandering to a right-wing populist audience that has skyrocketed his sub count on YouTube to over 5 million. 

We also discuss how he has followed the Joe Rogan business model to achieve this - collabing with guests such as Jordan Peterson, Tim Pool, Ben Shapiro and Jimmy Dore.

THE DOWNFALL OF RUSSELL BRAND - His Political Evolution on YouTube + SELLING OUT Palestine (Part 1),2022-03-11T04:00:07Z,PT48M45S,61484,2999,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Russell Brand has been largely known for his stand up comedy and various acting roles, but also for his outspoken political views. He has been exploding on YouTube recently, with a more well produced show apparently made by a team. His more recent more polished videos cover a wide array of topics but have recently been veering further and further into right-wing populism and right-wing conspiracy theories. 

However, Russell Brand has actually been making political content on YouTube since 2014 with his show 'The Trews'. This started out with him responding to stories in the daily newspaper. He often espoused left-wing anti-capitalist views, outlining his hate for Tony Blair and his belief in abolishing the Royal Family. He also made multiple videos outlining his support for Palestine, even promoting a BDS campaign on his YouTube channel. 

However, 2022 Russell Brand is far different. He has hardly discussed Israel-Palestine on his main channel - declaring it was wrong to take a side and he was not the man to discuss the issue because he was English that has been a coloniser historically. 

In this video, we look back at Russell Brand's career on YouTube and use the case study of his content on Israel-Palestine to show how he has changed.

Ben Shapiro says The Batman is Anti-White!? Anti-SJWs RAGE At 'WOKE' Politics + Diversity in Batman,2022-03-08T05:20:00Z,PT31M11S,43338,2770,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Matt Reeves 'The Batman' has recently released in cinemas to pretty widespread critical acclaim and has started its successful commercial run, breaking box office records since March 2020. 

However, the reactionaries are confused. Jeremy and Ryan Kinel from Geeks and Gamers both like the movie to some degree but still are left wondering why woke politics had to come into it. The casting of Jeffrey Wright as Commissioner Gordon and Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman already riled them up, but some of the light political commentary in the film has also sent them over the edge. 

Ben Shapiro has also shared this sentiment in his own absolutely stunning review. 

In this video we dissect the drama and talk about how Ben Shapiro is actually a failed screenplay writer - which explains so much.

The PewDiePie ADL Donation DRAMA 2.5 Years Later - Why Anti-SJWs HATE the ADL For the WRONG Reasons,2022-03-05T05:45:03Z,PT36M12S,26497,1406,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"From 2017-2019, PewDiePie was both king of YouTube and also insanely controversial. His edgelord humour had cultivated him a fan base with a heavy right-wing slant. In September 2019, he pledged to donated $50,000 to the Anti-Defamation League. His fans became completely outraged saying that the ADL was bad for being leftist, pro-censorship with obviously plenty of racially charged comments too. 

The Quartering and Tim Pool led the Anti-SJWs in also voicing their concern, although Tim Pool did say he liked the witch hunt the ADL was leading against Rep Ilhan Omar. However, none of the criticisms levelled at PewDiePie spoke of the ADL activism against groups supporting Palestine or it funding trips for US Police Departments to Israel to learn new tactics from the IDF and Israeli intelligence. Of Course, it is probably not surprising most of his fanbase did not care about these actions taking by the ADL. 

In the video, I recap the drama, the weak arguments made against the ADL and then present my own arguments abou the problematic aspects of the ADL.

The brutal Russian invasion stunned the world who rallied behind the Ukranian people in defence of their homeland. Of course, social media was where most of the reaction took place and it got weird. 

Crypto Bros jumped on the conflict to discuss how it proved that Bitcoin was the future - for both Russia and Ukraine. NFT scams have popped up claiming to be funding Ukranian relief efforts.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy decision to stay behind in the besieged country, which earned him global admiration. But even this got weird. Western liberals started discussing how good looking they found him (which apparently is relevant) and others started calling him Captain Ukraine because we have now reached the stage in society where adults can only process current events by viewing them as another movie in the MCU.

Is Putin the Next HITLER!? An Anti-NATO Leftist View on the HORRIFIC Russian Invasion of Ukraine,2022-02-25T02:30:02Z,PT29M28S,32608,1568,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Russia have launched an absolutely brutal invasion across the whole of Ukraine yesterday morning. Many have been caught by surprise, believing Russian dictator Vlad Putin to be bluffing and looking for concessions from NATO aligned countries or just annex Eastern Ukraine. This has been shattered as it looks like Putin is aiming to overthrow the entired Ukrainian government and install his own puppet. 

Most of the world is united in condemning the invasion and Russian aggression (including myself) but many are also banging the war drums further. Nancy Pelosi brought out the Hitler comparisons in calling the war our 'Sudetenland movement' - referring to the justification Hitler made to invade Czechoslovakia and later launched the Second World War. 

In this video, I give my reaction, including my perspective on NATO, the West and Putin and how media framing manipulates us into supporting escalation of conflict.

"Kyle Kulinski, Krystal Ball and The RISE of the Anti-WOKE Left - A War Against 'Identity Politics'",2022-02-24T06:15:00Z,PT44M41S,48438,2563,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"The Western Right-Wing have recently been non-stop complaining about 'woke', 'cancel culture' and 'identity politics' in their fight against the perceived Leftist surge that is undermining Conservative values. 

However, this isn't relegated to the Right. Recently, elements of the Left have taken up the war against woke. Kyle Kulinski and Krystal Ball believe the left's obsession with supposed identity politics is undermining the real fights all Americans need to be involved with such as universal healthcare. To these class reductionists, most problems in American society - including bigotry, racism and sexism - can ultimately be solved through economic reforms - while the cultural changes are far less important. 

Of course, in my view, these people are wrong. As someone from a country with better social programs, workers rights and universal healthcare - I feel these things do little to solve societal prejudices. In this video I go through and critique Kyle and Krystal's content.

No real details have emerged. You would expect the film to take place in Rapture - the setting of the first and second game - but also possibly Colombia the floating city of the third game. 

It didn't take long for Anti-SJW nerds to voice their concerns about the series. Would Bioshock be another property that would become 'WOKE' !?

Of course, the notion of Bioshock going 'woke' is quite funny to anyone who pays attention to the themes of the games. The original 2007 entry is a clear critique of Ayn Rand's objectivist capitalist philosophy, while 2013's Infinite is a direct criticism of American Exceptionalism. 

In this video, we get into the backlash and discuss the politics of Ayn Rand, the original Bioshock and how Randian economics became more influential.

Cancel Culture has become one of the most popular buzzwords in Liberals and mainly conservative circles. Whenever a conservative faces legitimate critcism from society, they cry censorship and cancel culture. Well hate to break it to you conservatives, Cancel Culture does not really exist. It is actually your precious free market working as intended. If a company chooses to work or not work with an individual, the company is not doing that out of genuine concern for social values. It is simply catering to the market - for the ultimate reason of making as much profit as possible. 

In this video we discuss the recent cancelling of Joe Rogan, Gina Carano and Kevin Sorbo and how these right-wing capitalists do not accept backlash against their views and potential economic consequences is a result of the capitalist system.

This is a cause predominantly taken up by the right-wing leading to many conservative gun ownership groups. This carries over to YouTube where many of the biggest firearms channels are run by Conservatives.

However, many also try to remain political which often leads to reactionaries in their audience exposing themselves when drama surfaces. Recently, there has also been a leftist movement to own firearms and even some representation on YouTube itself. 

In this video we look at various issues involved with this community and give my take on this culture.

Taking ideas from Tolkien's work and creating new characters, the show will document the rise of various factions and characters that feature heavily in the Lord of the Rings books and films. While Lore nerds seemingly didn't mind Peter Jackson omitting really important characters from his film, or literally changing the third act of the Return of the King, they have massively objected to the new diverse cast present in the show. Some are even going as far to say it attacks 'Anglo-Saxon' Culture - whatever that is supposed to be in 2022.

Hasan and Twitch Streamers are STEALING from YouTubers!?

Last year, Hasan streamed a Jay Exci video while cooking and eating dinner, sparking a wider conversation about if there is inherent exploitation going on in terms of streamers essentially padding their stream length in an effort to make more revenue. 

Jay Exci released another video last week calling out Hasan, while GTA speedrunner Dark Viper added the theory in a 14 page document outline how react content is broadly theft of YouTubers work - describing it as React Capitalism. Calling out both Hasan and Moist Critikal, Critikal then responded to the document before backing down and conceding that is React streams were not always an appropriate transformation of the content. 

However, Hasan took to Twitter to say that 99.9% of YouTubers actually love him featuring their content on his stream regardless of the context… Which many YouTubers (including myself) greatly objected too. 

In this video we go through the recent drama and discuss how the react stream content can be reformed in a way that is more far to original creators on YouTube.

However, recently many questions are being raise about the anonymous founders of the Bored Ape Yacht Club - the group that created the NFTs in the first place. Many people have pointed to their logo being designed just like an SS emblem from WW2. 

Twitter users have been digging up more evidence in which they think proves the founders of the BAYC are actually fash. Some of their evidence seems legit, some of it seems like a massive reach. 

In this video, we analyse the players involved and debate what is the most likely theory for the BAYC being full of seemingly fash adjacent imagery.

The INSANE Downfall of r/AntiWork - How a Reddit Mod's Fox Interview Created a Subreddit MELTDOWN,2022-01-28T04:15:01Z,PT31M11S,39322,1751,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"r/antiwork has been a rapidly growing subreddit on Reddit over the last year due to the Great Resignation that has been sweeping America. Many people are fed up with low wages and insane rising costs of living and housing. r/antiwork had been a subreddit that had gone viral due to images being posted there of text messages sent to people's bosses telling them they had quit. 

However, r/antiwork had been created 7 years ago by leftist anarchists who wanted to abolish work. Many people who joined the subreddit were not anarchists. Many were not even anti-capitalists and many were reformists. Despite the anti-capitalist nature of the sub remaining intact to a degree cracks were starting to show. 

This came to a dramatic head when one of the lead mod's gave a car crash interview to Fox News host Jessie Watters who used the mod to confirm everyone's stereotype of what a person who wants to end work sounds like... 

The reaction of the mod team was to lock the entire subredditt. 

I break down the drama in this video.

NAZIS LOVE HOBBITS!? Why The Far-Right LOVE Lord of the Rings and the RACISM of the Fantasy Genre,2022-01-26T05:04:00Z,PT32M38S,50413,2383,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"The fantasy genre is one of the most popular in the literary, film and TV worlds. Game of Thrones, The Witcher, Harry Potter and of course Lord of the Rings have been insanely successful in various different mediums and have been some of the most popular entertainment franchises of the 21st century. However, like most fiction, the world's created are often reflections of the authors worldview for good and for bad. 

JRR Tolkien is the Father of modern fantasy, and he also popularised the notion of mythical races. Creatures in the worlds of Middle-Earth or Hogwarts have  inherent characteristics which they cannot change or escape from - for the most part at least. In Harry Potter, the Goblins run the banks. In LOTR, the Uruk and Orcs are bred solely to fight for evil without nuance. 

These templates for 'races' are often taken from the authors own blind spots. While no extremist, Tolkien was not immune to the general racism of the British Empire. 

In this video, we discuss the general racism of the fantasy genre - from Twilight to LOTR.

Ethan has been podcasting for over half a decade at this point and has hosted multiple guests on his podcast. One of these guests was Jordan Peterson, who appeared on the podcast in November 2017 and February 2018. The pair seemed to get on. 

However, Ethan recently removed both episodes due to Jordan Peterson's further descent into right-wing politics. Jordan Peterson of course cried 'CANCEL CULTURE' due to this removal... Because being cancelled is a 4 year old podcast episode being removed from YouTube.

NORTH KOREAN Anti-SJW!? How Yeonmi Park is a Right-Wing GRIFTER and The FAKE NEWS of Radio Free Asia,2022-01-15T03:45:01Z,PT29M47S,35434,2221,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"North Korea is one of the most closed off nations in the world. Information coming out of the country is tightly controlled or spread by Koreans fleeing the country. However, due to the scarce information available, it is easy to lie about the dictatorship unchallenged. 

Yeonmi Park is one of the most famous N.Korean defectors, telling stories of how she used to eat mud and bugs while trying to survive the brutal conditions in the country. However, Park has seemed to forget the reality of her upbringing. Daughter of a party official, her family were wealthy with her own mother saying she used to import designer clothes from Japan while also saying they were never starving. Park is not alone, North Korean defectors embellishing their experience or flat out lying has now become very common - as many seek out the most lucrative ways to sell their stories to a still mysterious kingdom. 

Radio Free Asia is a radio show and website that runs the most stories about the internal politics and goings on of the hermit kingdom. In its original incarnation, it was little more than a CIA propaganda front. While not as explicitly an intelligence front, Radio Free Asia is directly funded by the US government, with the organisation that runs it being answerable to the the Secretary of State and the President. It runs many stories on North Korea, but its sources amount to little more than 'anonymous' citizens in North Korea. 

What is the purpose of spreading this misinformation? North Korea clearly isn't a place that people want to live in - so why embellish and lie? I discuss this in the video.

In a previous video, I discussed how the political YouTube podcasts broadly have the same guests on and have the same political leanings. You may have seen Yeonmi Park, well known North Korean grifter, appear on Lex Fridman, Joe Rogan, Jordan Peterson and also another podcast - one hosted by former Love Island 2015 contestant Chris Williamson. 

Chris started his podcast a fair few years ago, but slowly over time it became more political, echoing the politics of the larger YouTube podcasts. Guests include: Dave Rubin, Douglas Murray, Andy Ngo, Jordan Peterson, Michael Knowles, James Lindsay among a whole host of less noticeable right-wing grifters. 

He did once have David Pakman on, and Cosmic Skeptic, two liberals. But its hardly a balanced list of guests. Chris still does interview 'non-political' people occasionally like Danny Trejo.

Why The Far-Right SIMP For Japan and Why Japan has such a LARGE Communist Party (Who HATE the CPC),2022-01-08T07:00:06Z,PT30M36S,86766,4914,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Japan is one of the worlds largest economies that has historically not been very open to letting migrants travel and make the country their home. After WW2, American army bases came to dominate their islands, as the US designed their new political system and helped rebuild their economy. Under the domination of a Right-Wing Nationalist party (LDP), Japan has largely thrived despite multiple economic crashes. Many on the Right like to say Japan is very successful because while it participates in the global economy but does not open its borders to the workers of the world. Which in their view, means social problems are limited due to a lack of a 'clash of cultures'. 

However, they often ignore many of the internal problems of the country including how the lack of migrant workers has seriously undermined its economy as its population ages. 

Japan has a stereotype for having a mostly conservative population, but Japan is also one of the few capitalist countries with a relatively strong Communist Party who are actually a notable force electorally. Many of Japan's most famous creators often put left-wing messages in their films, animes and video games. These socialist politics have been shaped by the post-war period including the American occupation of Japan. 

In this video we discuss the Western Right's love for Japan (for all the wrong reasons) and why it does have a fairly large socialist movement.

It also allows you to screen people for their passions and values before you meet them. 

In this new age, Conservative Men have complained more and more that they can no longer get dates because every woman is looking for a man who shares their politics. They blame the growth of left-wing politics as the reason people will no longer tolerate dating conservatives and people right of centre. 

In this video, I talk about the politics of dating and why its okay to date people who share similar values to yourself. 

.00:00:00 - Intro 
00:03:00 - Tim Pool thinks men can't get a date because of progressive politics

J.K Rowling's Anti-Semitism Hypocrisy and Israelis call Emma Watson RACIST for Supporting Palestine,2022-01-05T05:20:01Z,PT32M10S,59373,3782,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Emma Watson recently shared a post on social media that contained a photo of a pro-Palestinian demonstration with a description about solidarity. The minor show of support for Palestinian rights sent right-wing Israelis into a frenzy and they labelled her as a racist. 

This shows the obvious cognitive dissonance. JK Rowling has voiced support for Israel consistently and has targeted people like Jeremy Corbyn in her fight against antisemitism. However, like many centrists and liberals her support for Israel does not mask her own bigotry. Her characterisation of Goblin bankers in her books and the onscreen adaptations has drawn widespread criticism and has been likened to an antisemitic caricature. Recently, John Stewart directly called her out for this blatant racist depiction in the movies. 

We also talk about the recent death of Desmond Tutu, and how Israel supporting UK politicians have mourned his passing without mentioning Tutu's longstanding support for both BDS and Palestine.

Personally for me it has been great. It has also been fun to see conservatives face some consequences when they have been directly challenged outside their echo chambers. Steven Crowder being pranked by Ethan Klein and Sam Sedar proved how hollow is 'debate me' stuff is, while Simu Liu and Zack Snyder calling out Geeks and Gamers and Anti-SJWs was hilarious.

The conflict entered the mainstream news cycle thanks to Bill O’Reilly, who started discussing it on Fox News back in 2004. Since then it has become a yearly discussion in the culture war of the USA.

Why the Alt-Right LOVE Rhodesia and The RISE of The Rhodeboos - Dylan Roof and SIMPS for the FAL,2021-12-23T05:00:12Z,PT27M26S,136852,4160,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Rhodesia is a long dead country that is idealised by the Far-Right. Now Zimbabwe, it was once a British colony founded by a corporation, the country declared its independence from the empire only to be thrust into turmoil as its Apartheid state collasped during its war with various rebel groups, including Communist ones who fought with Robert Mugabe. With Apartheid South Africa being one of its only allies, the settler colony eventually had its armies defeated. Many American mercenaries fought for the Rhodesian government. 

To the Far-Right, Rhodesia is a tale of what they warn the world about. A white apartheid country being taking over by African communists only for it itself to descend into anarchy - affirming both their anti-communism and their racism. 

Rhodesian merch and the 'iconic' Rhodesian FAL are popular with the gun communities online. They are also popular with the Far-Right including Dylan Roof. 

In this video, we go through the downfall of Rhodesia, explain why so many on the Far-Right ideolise it, and why it actually was an apartheid state despite frequent cries that it wasn't because it had an intergrated military.

The reaction to the show has been polarsing, with some people enjoying it despite some flaws with what they say is the dialogue. However, many Anime fans have been absolutely incenses by the mere existence of the show and have chosen to direct their anger and people who work on the show but didn’t write or direct any of the episodes. 

We also get into how again, Anime fans do not care about the subtext of their favourite shows and movies and simply say things have gone woke for being diverse.

The Rise and Fall of Milo Yiannopoulos - From Far-Right Poster Boy to ‘Ex-Gay’ Catholic Grifter,2021-12-09T07:00:12Z,PT36M57S,84015,2874,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Milo Yiannopoulos was everywhere in 2015 and 2016. He had carved out a career in journalism after flunking out of University and eventually landed a role at Breitbart. This outlet provided him with access to a growing alternative conservative movement that would help elect Donald Trump. 

From appearing multiple times on HBO’s Bill Maher show to getting a $250,000 book deal - how did Milo fall so far from his glory days. 

From being deplatformed to being shunned by the American Conservative movement, Milo now is a Christan grifter who goes around various Christian organisations appearing on their news shows, podcasts and shopping channels.

How Capitalism RUINED Halo Infinite and Battlefield 2042 (and all your favourite Games),2021-12-07T06:50:01Z,PT44M41S,21799,1532,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Online gaming has seemed like it is only getting worse the older the gaming industry gets. Many of the biggest franchises in gaming now employ shady pratices to try and get every last cent out of the players. However, this stuff was usually added in while the rest of the game remained in tact. Battle passes, season passes, skins, loot boxes and paid DLC have been the norm for about a decade now. 

But in Halo Infinite and Battlefield 2042 we see two once great franchises purposely released half baked entries solely due to the games being designed to be monetised after purchase. Halo's whole online progression is literally tied to the battle pass while BF2042 attempted to make a Warzone clone complete with operators which outraged the community. 

In this video we talk about how the gaming industry has been ruined by Capitalism, worker coops, and how games are ruining themselves in pursuit of ALL THE MONEY.

In this video we talk about the political theory of No Fap and why conservatives have become so attracted to it as a rejection of liberal values and progressivism on certain issues. 

While researching for my sigma male video I started getting a load of adverts for the NoFap movement. Bombarded by ads for seminars and programs, I took a deep dive down the YouTube rabbit whole. 

This movement is suprisingly very popular, with videos on the subject regularly getting millions of views with men trying to either beat addiction or trying to gain the health benefits of such a lifestyle. Health benefits that do not exist.

The games are set in a post-apocalyptic America, in an alternative timelines where the US never really moved past the 1950s. The game clearly satirises Cold War American politics including the hysteria around the Red Scare. 

However, many gamers have appeared to miss the satire completely. Instead they think Fallout is actually a game that is anti-communist. Nothing sums up how badly they missed the point in their simping for Liberty Prime, a ridiculous anti-communist mech who prowls the battlefield spouting Red Scare propaganda. 

In this video we look at the politics of the series and how Gamers so badly missed the point of the franchise.

Mr Beast's Squid Game Rip-Off MISSES THE WHOLE POINT of The Show’s Anti-Capitalist Messaging,2021-11-26T07:15:05Z,PT27M50S,43996,2376,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"The epic conclusion in my trilogy of videos CANCELLING Mr Beast!! 

In this series we have looked at Mr Beast exploitative content and charity work but now we turn our attention to his version of Squid Game. Mr Beast has essentially taken the popular dystopian anti-capitalist Korean drama, stripped all meaning of it to make a viral video to generate himself profit. 

In essence, he rips of the show without actually understanding it. He also fails to really credit the creator of the show - Hwang Dong-hyuk and can’t even bring himself to say his name at the end of the video.

Warhammer 40K still has a Fascism Problem - The Anti-SJW fans DONT UNDERSTAND The Imperium is SATIRE,2021-11-24T04:02:00Z,PT27M18S,84597,4408,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"The sequel to one of my most 'controversial videos' where I initially spoke about the Warhammer 40K community in August 2020. 

40K is well known to have reactionary elements within its fanbase, where there has been a clash between left-wing members and more conservative members over topics such as representation in both the lore and the tabletop gaming scene. Games Workshop did address this last year but many people felt it was lacking. 

However, a recent controversy in Spanish 40K has reignited the debate among the community. A player called 'Austrian Painter' openly wore fash symbols to a tournament and when players refused to play him because of this - he was given wins by default by the tourney organisers. This prompted Games Workshop itself to respond to these toxic elements among its community. 

However, many have accused GW of trying to have its cake and eat it too - mainly because the Imperium - a satire of a fash state - is used in most of its marketting which is often aimed at younger audiences. They are often presented as the 'good' guys in a universe where no one is good. But this undercuts the satire of the lore around the Imperium in the first place.

Looks like I’m coming back for more as the Mr Beast discourse has once again ramped up. People have been scrutinising Mr Beast’s charitable work which led to his millionaire best buddy Moist Cr1Tikal to go on a 10 minute speech about why Mr Beast is most genuine guy who has ever lived. A selfless person we haven’t seen the like off since Jesus Christ himself. 

Beyond the point that people do not have to simp for a millionaire, Mr Beasts philanthropic work does not stem from a place of genuine love for the planet. His constant shilling of crypto currency is testimony to this. Combine with the many possible tax reasons that Mr Beastie boy might want to do attention seeking charity - then there are plenty of reasons I can think not to like him.

Call of Duty Vanguard's UNAPOLOGETIC Anti-Fascism and WOKE Politics - WEHRABOOS WORST NIGHTMARE!?,2021-11-18T05:30:06Z,PT38M26S,48769,2376,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Call of Duty Vanguard takes the franchise back to its WW2 roots. Set in the final days of the war, an SOE team is tasked with making sure the Germans do not have the ability to regroup after the fall of Berlin. The game uses flashbacks to take you to the city streets of Stalingrad, the forests of Normandy, the Deserts of North Africa and the Jungles of the Pacific War. 

However, unlike many games in the genre, Vanguard does not shy away from the contraversial subject matter of the war, nor does it try to both sides the war or feature any 'honourable Germans' that features prominently in one of the campaigns of BattleField V. 

In this video, I analyses what I liked about Vanguard's approach as well as my criticisms of how it handled the subject matter and often did not go far enough in its commentary.

How Anti-SJWs Don't Understand Dune's Politics but HATE on 'WOKE' Eternals,2021-11-16T07:46:01Z,PT34M39S,52667,4056,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"The long anticipated Dune has exceeded many expectations. Doing well and the box office and having a sequel greenlit, the Sci-Fi epic has accumulated a lot of new fans. These included the people who criticise every film they see as ‘woke’ such as Ben Shapiro and Anti-SJW nerd media channels.

Recently they have been on the warpath against Marvel’s the Eternals for being ‘woke’ for simply having diversity. However, they seemed to have missed the entire message of Dune which is far more political. Dune was inspired by the anti-colonial revolutions of the 1960s and has many references to religion. If any film is woke out of the pair of them, it is Dune.

"Joe Rogan, Tim Pool and Conservatives LOVE George Carlin - Who was 'WOKE' and Would've HATED Them!",2021-11-13T06:47:01Z,PT33M15S,79726,4335,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"George Carlin is a legendary comedian in the US. He gained fame for his unfiltered approach to comedy where he often spoke about free speech and political correctness. This means he has a fair few fans in conservative and centrist circles who believe if Carlin was still alive he would have taken their side on most political issues. 

However, Carlin’s comedy often delved into politics directly and he was obviously left-wing. He focused on punching up, criticising America’s wealthy elite and rigged electoral system that always favours the wealthy. Much of what he says resonated with many on the left today but he has still been massively appropriated by the Right.

However, it was not always a joke, and for many is still not a joke. It is the man who does not fit into the alpha-beta binary. He has traits of both. An extrovert and an introvert. Both a leader and a lone wolf. 

However, what these classifications amount to is essentially astrology or horoscopes specifically for men.

Most are never ‘cancelled’ despite many complaining about cancel culture.

In the last three months, I have made two videos on Jontron and Hunter Avallone. Both have expressed right-wing politics on YouTube with only one making any visible progression.

SICK Conservatives JOKE and TROLL Alec Baldwin Over Shooting Tragedy Because he Played Trump on SNL,2021-10-23T03:46:01Z,PT18M11S,16991,964,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Alec Baldwin was part of a tragic shooting accident on the set of his new movie 'Rust' also starring Travis Fimmel. Halyna Hutchins, the Cinematographer, was killed while director Joel Souza was injured and taken to hospital

Alec Baldwin has been outspoken about the need for gun reform and has famously had a reoccuring role in playing President Donald Trump on SNL. He is widely loathed by Trumpists who are revelling in the shooting and using it as an opportunity to troll Baldwin. 

However, in terms of politics, recent Union action in Hollywood may have played a role in the accident, as non-union workers were brought in to work on the film which has been alleged to have poor working conditions and poor safety requirements.

How The Right Blame Communism for Capitalist Problems,2021-10-21T04:15:00Z,PT27M44S,26142,1716,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Squid Game is a worldwide phenomenon. Released by Netflix in September, the show has resonated with many across the world due to its commentary on the role of class, debt and the exploitative nature of the capitalist system. The creator of the show Hwang Dong-hyuk has even said the show is about capitalism. However, this didn't stop conservatives and Tim Pool from saying that the show is actually a criticism of Communism.

This follows a general trend of Conservatives blaming Communism for problems created by the global capitalist system due to them being conditioned to believe that capitalism can never be bad - only communism.

The Political Evolution of Ethan Klein - From Defending JonTron to Podcasting with Hasan Piker,2021-10-16T04:45:01Z,PT44M58S,145052,5340,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"H3H3 is one of the most well known YouTube brands on the platform. Starting as a comedy channel run by Ethan and Hila Klein, it slowly morphed into a media and clothing empire that saw their three channels gain millions of subscribers each. 

At the very beginning, H3H3 stayed away from politics and rarely gave their opinion. When they often did share their opinion it was about both sides of the spectrum being wrong. 

With their shift into podcasters, the pair and Ethan specifically could no longer avoid talking politics completely especially when they platformed primarily political people or longtime friends like JonTron. Ethan’s politics were fairly progressive in some ways but still focused on how both sides were flawed. 

However, in summer 2020 with the increased political unrest in America, Ethan seemed to have made a political shift leftwards, which became solidified in 2021 when he pranked Crowder and then created a new podcast with Hasan Piker.

However, the Crypto Bros don’t just want to make money - but think they are leading the world in global economic change.

Many of these people are libertarians who believe the lack of regulation and centralisation of bitcoin can actually empower your average person and they have heaped praise onto El Salvador for making Bitcoin legal tender - the first nation in the world. However, their views usually border on delusionals while the simp for billionaires like Elon Musk who are using cryptocurrencies to further enrich themselves.

The Matrix 4 and District 9 Sequel Go WOKE!? - How Anti-SJWs Dont Understand Their Favourite Films,2021-10-12T03:45:00Z,PT26M57S,23008,1500,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Ben Shapiro loves Blade Runner. This is a topic I discussed in a video about 5 months ago, in which I discussed how highly political conservatives often like films that directly criticise their points of view but without them realising it. The Blade Runner films obviously deal with capitalism and climate change. 

What I thought would be fun is to expand on this, but focus on upcoming sequels to popular movies. The Matrix and District 9 are both beloved films, with left-wing political messages. But these messages have been lost on many of the audience who now decry their favourite film going 'woke'. In the case of these two films, it is hard to see how they missed the point. 

My theory is conservatives can only consume media through its A to B plot, and either willingly or not, avoid the wider subtext of film.

Originating in the UK after the Hungarian Revolution in 1956, it has seen a resurgence in Leftist online spaces to describe those who have more authoritarian tendencies. 

After making a video about Taiwan, where I supported Taiwanese self determination, I was labelled a Tankie for giving the perspetive of China on the issue. To me this just confirmed something that I already knew, the term is being used as a blanket insult and criticism to just attack people that some leftists don't like.

Hasan Vs Dylan Burns on Supporting Taiwan against China and Leftist Blindspots on US Imperialism,2021-10-06T04:15:01Z,PT36M46S,26889,1220,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Being left wing often is associated with anti-imperialist viewpoints. This can be in regard to Northern Ireland, Israel, Kashmir, Western Sahara and Cuba. However, I have found that anti-imperialism, especially from Americans, seems to be influenced by the worldview of the US. This is most notable to me in regards to the conversation around Taiwan. 

While I broadly support Taiwanese self-determination, I do not support complete and unequivocal military support, arms sales and defence pacts between them and the US and Japan. Historically, this has inflamed tensions between the two territories which now feels like it is on a colision course for conflict. I also feel the use of Taiwan as a political pawn in America’s general imperialism in the region is massively understated - as it forms a key part of the US’s historic Island chain policy designed originally to undermine Soviet and Chinese efforts in the Pacific region. The US only cares about Taiwan as a strategic anti-China assest, not as a democracy. 

As an Irish person, I also completely understand why the people of mainland China and members of the Communist Party view Taiwan as a constant reminder of the imperialism that was done to China in its century of humiliation stemming from the Opium war and finally being ended by the victory of Mao over Chiang Kai-shek, who set up his opposition government on Taiwan. 

Often American leftists support for certain countries due to their personal political views often translates into carrying water for the US imperial strategy in places like China. And I feel these same arguments are often easily transferable to arguing for unequivocal support for Israel or perhaps even supporting Northern Ireland's continued separation from the Republic.

Steven Crowder MELTDOWN over Black James Bond! And Why I DON’T (?) Want a Black James Bond,2021-10-02T05:34:00Z,PT33M3S,18291,919,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"James Bond: No Time to Die, releases in cinemas across the world featuring the first black female 007, increasingly speculation that the next James Bond could be played by a black actress. This has of course sent conservatives and anti-SJWs into a frenzy. 

However, I believe James Bond should not be played by a black actor for entirely different reasons. A black James Bond makes sense but should we want a black actor to become the face of a franchise that famously drives up recruitment of MI6, an organsiation that has and does spread British Imperialism around the world.

How Anti-SJWs Politicize ALL Nerd Media as part of their CULTURE WAR Grift (Ft Nerdette’s NewsStand),2021-09-29T04:45:03Z,PT46M27S,21000,1178,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Anti-SJWs love to complain about politics in Nerd Media while literally politicising every casting choice, character choice, director choice and storylines for comic books, TV shows, Movies and Video Games. It gets to the point that you ask yourself: Do these guys actually like any of the things they claim to love? 

A couple weeks back, I had a great conversation with Tristen from Nerdette’s NewsStand. She used to be more part of the Anti-SJW side of fandom, and used to disagree regularly about my own takes on Nerd media, before she moved away from the Anti-SJW side after realising they were in it for the money and used culture war to manipulate their followers. 

Me and Tristen discuss their dominance in Nerd fandoms, if they actually care or know anything about various entertainment mediums and how this is often a reflection of US political discourse.

The Evolution of Hunter Avallone - How Vaush Pushed him Left and Why You DON'T Have to Forgive Him,2021-09-25T05:50:01Z,PT48M18S,82539,2892,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Code KAV for 20% off your first order at Ethic Attire: https://ethicattire.com/

Hunter Avallone was a conservative rising star. As a young adult he made many videos outlining his conservative American beliefs. From his love of Trump, his views on BLM and immigration. His views were extremely hard right and full of dog whistles, which he kept up in some form from 2015 to the end of 2019. 

In the middle of 2019 he had a child and also debated Vaush. He would later cite both as things that shifted his politics to the centre. From 2020 onwards, Hunter would outline progressively more left-leaning views and even went so far as to debunk multiple videos he had made in his reactionary phase - something that has not been common in the arc of most reformed reactionaries. 

However, despite his clear and seemingly sincere change, many people on the left don’t want anything to do with him. While some may say this is gatekeeping, I outline why people are allowed to still be uncomfortable with Hunter who built his name and fame on spreading radical political positions on YouTube.

The Anti-SJW MELTDOWN over ‘Race Swapping’ - God of War's Angrboda and Denzel Washington’s Macbeth,2021-09-23T04:30:02Z,PT27M21S,31468,1670,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Joel Coen's new film is his take on the Shakespeare classic Macbeth. Starring is wife Frances McDormand as Lady Macbeth and Denzel Washington as the character himself. This is nothing new, as Washington played Don Pedro in Kenneth Brannagh's Much Ado About Nothing. In Baz Lurhman's Romeo and Juliet, Mercutio was played by Harold Perrineau. In the theatre, many black actors have also acted in Shakespear plays. 

However, this is not stopped the Anti-SJWs, who have pounced on the new Macbeth trailer. This follows the revealation a couple weeks back that God of War Ragnarok would have Jotun Angrboda being played by a black actress. 

A common narrative in Anti-SJW circles is focused on the changing of a character's race for a woke virtue signaling agenda.

How 'Liberal' Celebrities Help Neo-Colonialism,2021-09-18T05:00:08Z,PT28M6S,11437,782,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"US actors, singers and general celebrities have become increasingly outspoke on social issues they care about. Domestically they often appear to be liberals, championing social cause most left leaning people care about. However, their views on foreign issues often aid US foreign policy. 

Recently, many Hispanis actos promoted SOS Cuba in support of the Cuban protests due to their worsening economic conditions. However, nearly all completely ignored the decades long embargo on the small island nation that has constantly created hardship in Cuba. 

The Riverdale cast also recently came out in support of SOS Nicaragua, due to the creator of the show's dad being arrested in the country, a once noteworthy politican in a non-Sandinista government in the country that has constantly been thrown into chaos by the US.

Anti-SJWs go MASK-OFF by Platforming Alex Jones!

Why the Anti-SJW HATE for God of War's 'Fat’ Thor is due to Unrealistic Male Body Types in Media,2021-09-14T04:30:00Z,PT30M19S,65041,3438,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"God of War Ragnarok finally showed off a small gameplay demo which showed the world of Midgard being greatly opened to Kratos and Atreus to explore. The game is set up for Freyja and Thor to be the main antagonists. The small gameplay snipper was widely praised, but Thor was not shown off much. 

That was until Santa Monica released character art of the cast including Thor. Unlike his Marvel cousin, this Thor was red-headed, tattooed with a larger frame shown and a larger belly slightly exposed. This caused Anti-SJWs to get mad that the God of Thunder that they have grown to love in the MCU was now alot larger like the version depicted in Endgame. 

In this video we discuss the perfect male body image that is potrayed in the media and how it affects us all - and I talk about my own experience with coming to accept my body.

Looking back at Hasan’s 9/11 comments and Disney Channel's INSANE Nationalist Propaganda After 9/11,2021-09-11T05:10:00Z,PT41M11S,17498,1187,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"9/11 is the defining event of the 21st century. The attack on the Twin Towers was captured in horrific detail, with the 24/7 global news media covering every little detail, from handheld cam recordings of the events of that day, to phone calls from people in the buildings or on the flights. This has cemented it into the memories of all who witnessed what happened that day and it has remained an event that is commemorated around the world each year. 

In the wake of tragedy the event actually showed the best and worst of humanity with many people sacrificing themselves heroically to save the lives of others. However, the legacy of 9/11 is not one of tragedy and bravery of America, but an event that was used to create global hysteria and justify any and all actions the American state deemed fit to use in its war on terror. 

In this video we take a look at the legacy of that day, including looking at Hasan Pikers controversial comments, how Disney Channel pushed nationalist propaganda in the wake of the tragedy, and if America really brought it upon themselves and how they used the event to to justify inflicting pain and suffering on millions of the poorest people in the world.

After recently seizing power again in Afghanistan, viral videos of Taliban soldiers emerged using bumper cars, going to the gym and eating Ice Cream. Another component is their social media accounts. Various Twitter profiles that seemingly are run by Taliban members have been posting memes satirising the US war, criticsing Western Muslims and Western culture while promoting the superiority of the new Taliban rule in Afghanistan. 

In this video, we look at the Taliban meme accounts and discuss who this appeals too in the West.

'WOKE-ism is WORSE than North Korea!’ - Yeonmi Park and Why NK refugees help Right-Wing Grifters,2021-09-03T04:00:30Z,PT29M28S,36322,2104,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"North Korea is one of the most closed off countries in the world. Most people cannot visit the country apart from on very monitored tours or if they are from countries like Russia or China who have long standing links with the natio. In the same way, you are not going to find too many North Koreans who haven’t fled the country outside of it - apart from some of the wealthier families sending their kids to study abroad. 

Yeonmi Park is one of thousands of refugees who have fled the DPKR. Most end up in South Korea with others going to live in America or the UK. Yeonmi is one of the most prominent with a 600k subscriber YouTube channel with pretty decent views per video and recently she has been promoting her new book on the Right-Wing podcast grifting circuit becoming a favourite of Jordan Peterson, Lex Fridman and Joe Rogan. 

However, if these hosts even committed to carrying out a shred of research on Yeonmi Park, they would realise that her accounts of life in North Korea are dubious, as she came from a well off family and has given multiple conflicting accounts of significant events that happened during her life there.

00:03:35 - Who is Yeonmi Park
00:07:19 - Yeonmi Park says being woke is worse than North Korea

"Why I DON'T Like David Pakman - A Leftist Critique of Pakman on Israel, BDS, Capitalism and Cuba",2021-09-01T04:35:00Z,PT41M3S,40327,2334,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"David Pakman is one of the most popular online progressive commentators and one of the oldest left leaning politics channel. David has covered international and domestic politics for years seeing a huge growth during the presidency of Donald Trump.

On a recent video I said in an offhand comment that I didn’t like David Pakman. Of course I don’t know him, but I meant his politics. This surprised quite a few of my regular viewers who wanted further elaboration on my problems with David.

So I put together this video. Here I outline my problems and general differences of opinions with David Pakman to outline how we are politically quite different.

.00:00:00 - Intro 
00:04:09 - David outlines why he isn't a socialist but a Nordic style SocDem
00:12:00 - David outlines his criticisms of Cuba 
00:18:30 - David talks about why he didn't cover Israel in the news quickly 
00:19:50 - David talks about why its wrong that BLM support BDS
00:29:28 - What David gets wrong about Malcolm X 
00:31:30 - The truth about Nelson Mandela and Malcolm X

The Grifting World of YouTube Podcasters - Elon Musk SIMPS who PROMOTE the WORST Conservatives,2021-08-28T02:00:03Z,PT24M46S,30006,1681,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Joe Rogan has become a household name, not for his MMA commentary, career as a comedian or previous acting work - but because of his extremely popular podcast: The Joe Rogan Experience.

Suprisingly Joe Rogan is one of the better podcasters for having a semblance of balanced guests. However, he still overwhelmingly slants to the right helping to promote the likes of Sam Harris, Jordan Peterson, Dave Rubin and various other figures in the intellectual dark web. 

However, you may be unaware there is a whole a YouTube podcast eco-system that all platform the exact same guests. So if you watch Joe Rogan, Lex Fridman, Triggernometory or Chris Williamson you will be treated to each having their own seperate interview with: Sam Harris, Jordan Peterson, Sargon of Akkad, Andy Ngo, Andrew Doyle, Douglas Murray, the Weinstein brothers as well as people who are famous for nothing else but appearing on podcasts like Michael Malice or Gad Saad. They also seem to get the exact same new guest on at the same time. 

I dissect this ecosystem and how damaging it can be for normalising lots of problematic figures.

MARTIN LUTHER KING NOW IN FORTNITE!!! How MLK's Revolutionary Politics and Legacy have been ERASED,2021-08-27T02:30:07Z,PT23M22S,11528,776,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Martin Luther King has now entered the world of Fortnite. This is not a joke. 

Tbf, his inclusion comes as part of a digital museum in the game aimed at teaching younger people about the Civil Rights movement. But to me it points to a wider probelm - The sanitisiation of Martin Luther King. He was largely anti-capitalist and scathingly critical of the US war in Vietnam but is now used as a type of apolitical figure to promote a liberal view of civil rights.

How OnlyFans and Tumblr BETRAYED Sex Workers And the Far-Right Christian Groups Trying to BAN Porn,2021-08-25T03:45:01Z,PT28M28S,12698,847,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"OnlyFans recently announced it was changing it terms of service in a move that would drastically restrict the use of the platform for sex workers who made OnlyFans a household name. This is nothing new, Snapchat, Patreon and most famously Tumblr all were platforms that used to host NSFW content before eventually putting restrictions on it either due to a desire to change a public perception or they were bought out by another company - with Tumblr being bought by Yahoo and then Verizon. 

OnlyFans is unique in the sense that is is synonmous with NSFW content from Sex workers, while the ones that came before at least were platfroms mainly for other types of content. So why did OnlyFans change? Of course it seems money is the primary factor although this may be more nuanced than it first appeared. Secretive Right-Wing American Christian groups have been targetting banks that do business with OnlyFans and other types of NSFW industries due to their goal to remove this type of content entirely from the internet.

OUTRAGE at ‘FAKE’ Socialist Hasan Piker for Buying Expensive Home for His Family (Just Like Bernie!),2021-08-21T02:57:01Z,PT25M26S,16834,1153,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"A very popular line of attack liberals and conservatives alike use on leftist is that they should not purchase expensive things otherwise they are all exploitative capitalists. A popular line of attack in the 2020 Democratic Presidential Primary was that Bernie Sanders was a hypocrite and not a socialist because he had earned $1.75 million from book sales since 2016, and had purchased a holiday cabin in Vermont, to go with his small one bedroom DC apartment (that cost an extortionate $700k) and family home that he and is wife took out a mortage of $300,000 dollars like a typical older couple. 

Now this line of attack is being used on 30 year old Twitch streamer Hasan Piker who has recently purchased a $2.7 million house in LA for him, his mother and his brother to live in. Many have now called him a hypocrite and a fake socialsit because he used money, that was earned with little exploitation, to buy a property in the city where he already lives.

"'The Taliban is BASED' - Candace Owens, Nick Fuentes and Conservatives SIMP for the Taliban Takeover",2021-08-20T02:50:00Z,PT29M48S,23298,1320,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Afghanistan has once again fallen to the Taliban. Overthrown in 2001 by a NATO and warlord coalition, the political movement waged a guerrilla campaign against the West and its allies for twenty years before sweeping back into power this month. 

The Taliban have gained notorioirty for good reason, but the most patriotic of all conservatives now find themselves actually agreeing with the Taliban on many issues, including social policies. 

On the other side of the political spectrum, Liberals want the Afghanistan occupation to actually be re-established to protect women's rights. I also discuss the history of women's rights in the country and how the West have historically used women to justify their own colonialism.

How ‘Debating’ Lauren Southern is Helping to Rehabilitate her Image and Erase Her Far Right Activism,2021-08-18T04:05:00Z,PT35M1S,29758,1717,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Lauren Southern as built her career as an extremely contraversial far right activist. Not only did she believe awful things, she made propaganda in the form of documentaries and actively participated in activism against refugess. She disappeared from the online space in 2019, only to come back in 2020 as a reformed centrist. 

Since then she has been slowly entering the enthralling world of Twitch livestream debates. With the likes of Hunter Avallone, Xanderhal, Destiny and the Serfs. Some of these debates essentially amount to friendly chats where Lauren's very problematic past is rarely discussed while others descend into something more hostile, tellingly when Lance from the Serfs did actually confront Southern on her past. 

Has Southern actually changed? Judging by her platforming Afrikaan activists on her channel recently - I am going to say: no.

The Trump Supporting UK 'Incel' Mass Shooter's Reddit Account PROVES Misogyny Fuelled his Rampage,2021-08-14T02:52:01Z,PT23M55S,25230,1595,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"The UK suffered one of its worse shootings in the 21st century, and worst in a decade, after 22 year old Jake Davidson killed and injured numerous people, including his own mother and a child. Going through Jake's 9 month old reddit account, it is clear misgoyny was central to his rampage. 

Jake blamed his mother, one of his victims, for his personal failings with women, while posting on r/MensRights, r/IncelExit, r/Virgin amongst various other subreddits where he lamented his supposed fatness, ugliness and his inability to talk to women. He outlined how he had been redpilled, black-pilled and believes that the government shoud set up programs to help Incels talk to women and become more accpeted in society. He also outlined how he viewed women has having everything easier in society, and only go for the most alpha male of men. 

I go through his various posts and comments to analyse his ideology.

How Jordan Peterson’s Cultural Marxism CRUSADE Helps New Zealand’s Neo-Nazis (Alt-Right Pipeline),2021-08-12T03:35:00Z,PT27M31S,19045,1262,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Jordan Peterson became notorious in his crusade against supposed leftist academia by talking about the West being ruined by Cultural Marxism. Cultural Marxism has long been something the Right has fear mongered about but by and large it is mainly used as racist discredited theory which often helps people become more radicalised. 

New Zealand facists have recently said in an undercover report that deplatforming them is bad because they can't reach those people who watch Jordan Peterson and may be on the fence to joining a more radicial cause. In this video we discussing how Cultural Marxism and Jordan Peterson can take people down the rabbit hole.

The Anti-Native American Racism of the Twilight Franchise - White Vampires Vs Indigenous Werewolves,2021-08-10T03:15:00Z,PT24M4S,19402,1329,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Twilight was one of the most popular franchises in the late 2000’s and early 2010’s. Picking up on the hype for young adult novels, Twilight rode the coattails of the successful Harry Potter series even casting HP actor Robert Pattinson as the lead vampire Edward Cullen. The film and book series often sees white western Vampires face off against ‘werewolves’, technically shapeshifters, who can turn into wolves to fight off vampires. These wolves are exclusively Native America, a fictionalised depiction of the real life Quileute tribe. 

However, author Stephanie Meyer chose the tribe for her stories without ever even visiting the local area or consulting extensively with tribal members. Furthermore, she actually went to the area after the book was written and violated the mandate around nature the tribe had enacted. 

The problematic depictions of natives in Twilight are both surface level and more sinister, and it has had a complicated effect on the Quileute tribe itself. Native actors who performed in the film series have also acknowledged the problem with how the tribe was represented in the film and book series. 

While some natives have credited the franchise for bringing native representation into the 21st century, others have pointed out how it is guilty of the same problems and stereotypes natives have always faced in Hollywood.

Call of Duty Publisher is Run by REPUBLICANS Who Oversaw Bush's TORTURE Programs and Trump's CIA,2021-08-07T02:30:04Z,PT28M22S,10617,791,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Conservatives always seem to complain about the so called political agenda's of various developers infecting their favourite gaming franchises. Something they are more quiet on are both the awful right-wing politics that are front and centre in military shooters or the prominence of former Republican donor, activists and politicians in gaming. Donald Trump's brother was a board member of Bethesda, while Activision-Blizzard has, in 2021, hired two veterans of the Bush administration and one of the CIA under the Trump Administration. 

Fran Townsend is most notorious in this regard, with the top people running Abu Ghraib telling the press in 2004 that she personally told them to ramp up interrogations to get more 'results' out of the prisoners.

I break this down in the video.

The Evolution of The Amazing Atheist from the Father of Anti-SJW YouTube to ‘Feminist’ Bernie Bro,2021-08-05T02:00:08Z,PT51M24S,110735,3518,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"TJ Kirk aka the Amazing Atheist is one of the oldest YouTubers who has covered current events, religion and politics since 2007. He often debunked religious arguments coming from Republicans and often expressed his displeasure with the corporations who ruled America and had advocated for a public option for health insurance and universal healthcare. TJ is also widely seen as the first real Anti-SJW YouTuber, creating a form of content that would long outlast his material with many skeptics abandoning atheism for the anti-SJW form of content. 

He made videos critiquing people like Anita Sarkeesian, but would also move onto criticising Donald Trump. Unlike many anti-SJWs, TJ’s atheism meant he was no friend to Trump and actively supported Bernie Sanders for President in 2016 and 2020. 

If you look and Kirk’s channel in 2021 it seems like a standard BreadTube adjacent anti-capitalist left-wing channel. Due to interviews with people like Vaush, Kirk has become welcomed in many online lefty circles. By and large I do not have a problem with Kirk’s current output, but I believe he has a massive blindspot when he talks about race in America. 

In 2019 and 2020 he put out several videos that showed his blindspot, in which he also advocated for people to be ‘colour blind’. While recognising the counter arguments to this world view, it seems Kirk’s pro-equality, anti-theism and anti-capitalism stances hasn’t yet led him to the conclusion that race is deeply connected to these systems and beliefs he rails against. 

This video documents the throughline in his politics, his shift leftwards and the problematic beliefs he still holds.

Anita Sarkeesian was RIGHT!? The DERANGED Skeptic Hysteria around Feminist Frequency - 8 Years Later,2021-07-31T04:45:00Z,PT38M22S,51277,2655,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Anita Sarkeesian is one of the most infamous internet feminists. She started her online work in 2009, but rose to prominence with her YouTube video essays on Feminist Frequencey. In 2013, she made a three part series on the Damsel in Distress trope seen in video games which triggered a huge backlash from Skeptic, Atheist and gaming Youtubers. Her image was distorted to the masses and she was depicted as an uninformed political activist trying to ruin video games. 

But 8 years on, does this still hold up? Was the backlash justified? Simply put: no. If Anita released her videos today no one would care. The rise of BreadTube has made this media analysis common in the YouTube space. However, the narratives and misinformations would become a key feature of Anti-SJW YouTube channels which continue to rack in millions of views until this day.

The Right-Wing CIVIL WAR Over if they should Accept Trans People and Porn Stars into Conservativism,2021-07-30T02:18:00Z,PT21M53S,17895,1045,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Conservatives strength is often the fact they rally around a politician or certain ideology to help them win power. But every so often the Right-Wing starts fighting against itself. This has happened this month due to two events. Firstly, Caitlyn Jenner received various endorsements from conservatives after announcing her run to be the next Governor of California, and this was met with fury from more religious conservatives who believe endorsing Jenner is a sign that some conservatives are giving into the left and playing identity politics. 

Secondly, adult entertainer Brandi Love was booted out of a Turning Point USA Conference for seemingly no good reason. But Candace Owens, Matt Walsh and Charlie Kirk all said that both her appearance was inappropriate and she was not an actual conservative because of her profession.  

I break down the drama and conservative hypocrisy.

"DISNEY IS ANTI-COMMUNIST!? How US Sitcoms, Cartoons + Comics have SPREAD Anti-Socialist Propaganda",2021-07-27T04:37:00Z,PT30M33S,17073,1224,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"America has created some of the biggest TV shows, comics, cartoons in world history. However they have often fallen under either government supervision or censorship. The original Scarface had its ending changed and had an anti-crime message from the government shoehorned in at the start, and with the post-WW2 red scare many artists were blacklisted.

At the same time, the FBI and the armed forces were often influencing media to portray and pro-American pro-capitalism message. 

This has continued - somehow - until the present day with Girls Meets World having a whole episode dedicated to criticising socialism.

JonTron’s INSANE Racist Debate with Destiny 4 Years Later - and how He faced ZERO Consequences,2021-07-24T04:45:01Z,PT42M47S,383473,16220,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Conservatives love to cry about Cancel Culture - the view that if they say something that is out of lockstep with the liberal elite then they will be censored, deplatformed or lose their job. 

In reality, conservatives are the least likely to be cancelled. Case in point JonTron. JonTron got into a lot of controversy for his debate with Destiny on immigration and demographics in the USA back in March 2017. I had never actually watched it. Upon watching it it’s clear how insanely offensively JonTron was but he has since faced little consequence for his actions. 

He began reuploading 4 months after this drama and regularly pulls in millions of views on his over 6million subscriber channel.

QUEEN of the Cult of Musk!? How Grimes Went from Quoting STALIN in her Yearbook to Dating Elon Musk,2021-07-23T02:00:04Z,PT28M18S,158796,6230,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Elon Musk has cultivated a significant cult following over the last decade. His work on electric cars at Tesla, space flight at SpaceX and neurotech at Neuralink has captured the imagination of nerds across the world, while his meming twitter persona has helped create a cult of personality who will not tolerate a bad word about Musk or his companies and business ventures. 

However, one of his strangest fans, who turned into the mother of his child and partner, was the artist Grimes. Grimes cultivated a fan base that was completely opposite to Musk’s. Growing up on the music of Nine Inch Nails and the Smashing Pumpkins at school, Grimes developed an inclusive and socially progressive audience that was the antithesis of fanbase around Musk. Raised on Sci-Fi novels like Dune, and fascinated by AI, Grimes was attracted to Elon based on a shared joke they both had about an obscure AI concept. 

In the past Grimes has spoken about income inequality, communism and even quoted Josef Stalin in her yearbook. She too has been seduced by the persona of Elon Musk who is seen as a benevolent Tony Stark billionaire saviour of planet earth. She now spends her time promoting Musk’s ventures while also leaping to his defence as her fans criticise his poor treatment of his workers and often offensive twitter outbursts.

However, many also become grifters due to peddling a specific type of dubious product. This is nothing new and in this video we look at the Freedom Phone and show how it is just yet another product to be advertised by these conservatives talking heads to their gullible audiences.

Destiny and Vaush are two of the most prominent of them on the Liberal and Left side of the spectrum, while Steven Crowder and Ben Shapiro have carved out their own media empires based on 'owning the libs' in edited YouTube videos showing their debating prowress. 

There is much debate over how much value the online debate scene has to the online Left. In the video we go through how some of my followers have been influenced by debate bros while also acknowledging the downsides and toxicity of the format.

How Anti-SJWs Don't Understand that Captain America has ALWAYS been 'WOKE' and Political,2021-07-15T02:42:00Z,PT24M18S,20277,1353,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Since the release of the First Avenger in 2011, Captain America has become one of the most popular movie characters of modern times. Played by Chris Evans, the earnest and moral Cap would never fight for the wrong cause. Despite dabbling in more political themes in Winter Soldier and Civil War, most Anti-SJWs let this depiction of Steve Rogers slide. However, with the dawn of the Falcon and the Winter Soldier TV series, where Sam Wilson takes up the mantle, many conservatives and Anti-SJWs have made Captain America a part of their culture war, and they are also scrutinising the newer comic iterations of the superhero. 

However, since his inception Captain America has been a progressive liberal patriot, who has constantly called out many of the worst aspects of America while promoting inclusivity and diversity. We dissect the characters background in this video.

Ben Shapiro is AGAINST Nick Fuentes Twitter Ban - How The Right only Cares about its OWN Free Speech,2021-07-13T02:15:00Z,PT24M38S,18330,851,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Conservatives like Michael Knowles and Ben Shapiro like to paint themselves as champions of free speech. Recently both came out against Twitter's ban of Nick Fuentes, despite both of them having outlined strong disagreements with him in the past. Seems like the thing a principled free speech absolutist would do right? 

Well... not really. Conservatives only care about Free Speech when it is to do with their side. They stay silent on real issues to free speech and are often responsible for attacking it in the first place.

Is there a WEEABOO to TOJOBOO Pipeline!? How Weeb Culture can create SIMPS for Imperial Japan,2021-07-09T02:30:01Z,PT30M2S,14775,702,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Weeaboos and Otakus are often seen as obsessive although harmless super fans of Japanese culture. They mainly focus on the entertainment aspects but often also Japan’s cultural practices and even politics. 

Japan itself has been largely controlled by the hard-right in the post-1945 period, who have white washed its own history over the last 200 years, even the Second World War. It is therefore not surprising that some Weebs become Tojoboos

He has recently also made films that tap into his Jewish background. In 2020, he spoke candidly about his religious upbringing and how he only learnt to question it as he got older. Now he has committed his Twitter to rebuking various bad faith actors that seek to use his experience against him.

The Slow DEATH of New Atheism and the Skeptic Community - Trading Atheism for an Anti-SJW GRIFT,2021-07-03T02:00:12Z,PT33M45S,79360,3499,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Anti-SJW YouTube content is still extremely popular, with The Quartering and Geeks and Gamers being two of the more prominent channels who covered this stuff. But this style of content actually grew out of the YouTube Skeptic community, primarily New Atheist types who made videos criticising religion and slowly starting shifting their content to targeting feminism and then finally leftist politics in the form of SJWs. These included Chris Ray Gun, Shoe on head, Armoured Skeptic and Sargon of Akkad.

While many of these guys revered New Atheists like Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins, at a similar time these academics where also going through a similar tradition. They swapped criticism of organised religion and religious Dogma for waging a conflict for conservatives in the Culture War. 

In this video I discuss the deaths of both YouTube Skeptics and the New Atheist movement.

Why Anti-SJWs (seriously) Think GAMERS are OPPRESSED - Stereotypes + Games being Ruined by Feminism,2021-07-01T02:05:01Z,PT24M30S,29479,1661,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Gamers Rise Up is a popular meme, complete with the 'they targetted gamers, gamers' meme. I never took this at face value, before further investigation... 

Anti-SJWs have long railed against the supposed intrusion of progressive politics into gaming and believe that gaming has been undermined by the woke mob who only want to use the medium to push their politics and do not care about whether a game is 'fun'. 

In this video I show you the bizarre reason why Gamers think they are discriminated against.

This Far-Right Politician LOVES FEMBOYS and FURRIES? (Libertarian-Monarchist Janusz Korwin-Mikke),2021-06-29T02:35:01Z,PT22M51S,21386,980,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Janusz Ryszard Korwin-Mikke is a Polish politician who has held various political positions since 1992. He now describes himself as a libertarian monarchist, constantly inciting rage due to his consistent and unhinged comments about refugees, women, socialists and Islam. 

But unlike many politicians Korwin-Mikke has been spotted numerous times attending cosplay events, pictured shaking hands with furries the most, but also Spongebob and various other comic book characters. In his most famous picture he is lifting up a Femboy for a photo. He has also been interviewed by Sargon of Akkad on at least three occassions.

In Poland, the far-right has been gaining ground in the Polish youth which may explain some of Korwin-Mikke's actions. 

(He was a member of the European Parliament from 2014 until 2018. He was the leader of the Congress of the New Right which was formed in 2011 from Liberty and Lawfulness, which he led from its formation in 2009, and the Real Politics Union (Unia Polityki Realnej), which he led from 1990 to 1997 and from 1999 to 2003. Currently, he is the chairman of the party KORWiN, and since 2019 he is a member of the Sejm, elected from the electoral list of Confederation Liberty and Independence.

The RISE OF IDF TikTok CAT GIRLS and US Army Twitch Streamers (Dystopian Imperialist Propaganda),2021-06-26T01:00:02Z,PT26M17S,11089,639,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Blade Runner by Ridely Scott was released in 1982 and set in November 2019, and it feels as we move past this date we are entering a more a more dystopian world predicated by the liked of Philip K Dick. 

The US army has a long relationshop involving itself in video games, either producing or consulting on best selling titles. But now it is focusing its recruitment effort on young members of the population who may be into esports and twitch personalities. Israel is keeping his finger on the social media pulse, and now regulalry uses TikTok to spread its message - including bizzarley using Cat Girls in their videos. 

I break down the dystopian uses of propaganda and what one is worse.

The Steven Crowder - Sam Seder 'debate' EXPOSES how Conservatives will ONLY Debate Easy Targets,2021-06-24T02:25:00Z,PT24M27S,37732,2478,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Steven Crowder's latest meltdown is another entry into the right-wing's inability to engage in a fair debate with people to the left of them. Ethan Klein had to trick Crowder into appearing on a livestream with Sam Seder which caused him to become visibly agitated before abruptly leaving the stream. This is a guy who has made a career of debating random strangers. The trick being he controls the content of these debates that are uploaded to his channel. 

This also happened to Ben Shapiro. The king of the debates, couldn't handle a 10 minute video with BBC's Andrew Neil before abruptly storming off the interview after calling Neil a leftist. Andrew Neil is one of the most visible conservatives in UK media. 

I break this down.

"How the CULTS of Personality around JonTron, Scott Cawthon and David Dobrik Prevent Accountability",2021-06-22T02:30:08Z,PT27M18S,22000,1328,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"YouTubers and online creators are no strangers to drama. David Dobrik and Five Nights at Freddy's Creator Scott Cawthon have recently been involved in high profile controversy. Scott had maxed out his donations to some of the worst hard-right GOP politicians including Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump while David has been accused of treating mutliple employees badly. JonTron had his own controversy back in 2017, where he outlined his extremely reactionary right-wing politics. 

David Dobrik has just made his comeback - his audience has forgiven him. JonTron has been back for years with an audience who do not care about his political views, while Scott has recently retired but still has the overwhelming love of his community. What links Scott and JonTron is that while they acknowledged the controversy, they only offered tepid non-apologies for what they had done. Dobrik squeaked out a first attempt at an apology on his second channel, before bawling his eyes out on his main channel grovelling for forgiveness on his main channel days later after more allegations came out against him. 

In the video we break down how the relationship between online creator and audience has created multiple cults of personality which allow these creators to all get off the hook for their various controveries.

-3:58 - The Leaks 
-9:49 - Neil Druckmann betrayed the fans
-14:31 - Game is badly written because you don't get revenge
-22:09 - Abby is an unrealistic and badly written character
-27:42 - Game is ruined by a woke agenda
-31:09 - It should have been about Joel and Ellie

The Last of Us Part II was one of the most critically acclaimed games of the last generation of consoles - sweeping award ceremonies winning in categories such as Acting, Directing, Art, Gameplay and Narrative. It has also sold very well. 

However, the games narrative was actually leaked in April 2020 causing a firestorm of Anti-SJW vitriol. Many hated what the game was going to be and the hate did not stop - even until this day.

In this video we look back at the Anti-SJWs reaction to this game and respond to many of its popular alleged ‘criticisms’.

References to various entertainment are common and are even adopted by political movements. This happens across the left and right but today we are looking at how the Right adopt the aesthetics from left-wing films and appropriate them for their own ends.

He has grown a strong and supportive community that was recently polarised after it learned Scott has very recently been a big GOP donor - giving to numerous prominent GOP politicians including giving donations to President Trump in his reelection bid. 

The community is split, but many are still strongly supportive while a smaller group calling Scott out are being drowned out on the community's main hub - the Five Night at Freddys subreddit. 

I break it all down in this video.

Wehraboos LOVE Battlefield!? How Battlefield V's German Campaign pushed the Clean Wehrmacht Myth,2021-06-12T02:30:08Z,PT31M48S,19183,942,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Battlefield V was Dice’s 2018 entry into the series which face widespread criticism for the inclusion of women and minority soldiers on the battlefield as the ‘inaccurate’. 

However there was less criticism for the DLC free Singleplayer campaign called the Last Tiger. This campaign was set in the final months of WW2, following a Tiger tank crew in Germany during the collapse of the German armed forces. 

In this video we will dissect the campaign and discuss how it pushes the Clean Wehrmacht myth - the believe that the German Military were not complicit in the motives and worse actions taken by the Germans during the war

'Abby is Unrealistic!' - How Anti-SJWs Can't Accept Female Characters that Are NOT Objectified,2021-06-10T02:45:03Z,PT26M34S,37880,2207,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Gamers (TM) have been outraged over the last five years or so due to the emergence of new female protagonists in big budget games, that are not as objectified as those who came before. Not only that, the ones from the 1990s that were objectified like Tifa and Lara Croft, have had their character models revised - much to the displeasure of Anti-SJW and reactionary gamers. 

In this video we talk about the recent controversy with Aloy, Tifa and also Abby from the Last of Us Part II and how the standard applied to female game characters is rarely applied to male.

PAUL RYAN LOVES RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE: How Conservatives Don’t Understand their Favourite Bands,2021-06-05T02:26:00Z,PT26M24S,23417,1482,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"We have already discussed how Conservatives do not understand their favourite video games and movies. But now we are discussing music. Paul Ryan is a big Rage Against the Machine fan, Trump played CCR’s ‘Fortunate Son’ at his rallies, David Cameron loves The Smiths, Tim Pool and PJW love Radiohead. The phenomenon of right-wingers loving bands that absolutely do not like people just like them is very common. But all the bands listed have both sung anti-conservative political songs and have usually spoken about their own anti-establishment politics. 

In this video we look at several famous instances of right-wingers expressing their love for lefty bands and being rejected by them.

"Why The Alt-Right LOVE Spartans, 300 and the Battle of Thermopylae",2021-06-03T02:30:02Z,PT26M34S,24496,1203,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"The Spartans of Ancient Sparta are hailed as one of the greatest fighting forces in the history of mankind. Beginning their training as children, Spartan men would serve in the military from 20 years old to 60. They fought numerous wars against surrounding Greek states and also most famously the Persian empire. 

In recent history, the 1930s fascists loved the society designed by the Spartans and used them in their propaganda. In modern times, the alt-right have found a symbol that shows the West standing against the ‘East’ represented by the Battle of Thermopylae. They have only become more popular thanks to 300, the Zack Snyder film that depicts this battle in an insanely orientalist way which helped make it easy to use nationalist propaganda especially in Greece. 

I break down the historical revisionism inherent in the myth of Sparta.

Why People are Calling Ellie Kemper a ‘KKK Princess’ - The Racist History of the Veiled Prophet Ball,2021-06-02T02:30:06Z,PT24M3S,30566,1505,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Ellie Kemper recently came under fire on Twitter as it re-emerged that she was crowned the Queen of the Veiled Prophet Ball/Pageant. This event has strong ties to both former confederate soldiers and also wealthy businessmen in St. Louis. It sprang up in response to the 1877 Railroad strike, where both black and white workers in Missouri joined together to strike for better working conditions. The ball was designed to help the traditional white elite in St Louis remain the dominant force. 

In this video, we look at the history of the Veiled Prophet, the Kemper family and how much is she responsible for taking part in the ball.

https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tasneemnashrulla/ellie-kemper-veiled-prophet-ball-queen-racist

Buzzfeed reporting: Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt actor Ellie Kemper came under fire over the Memorial Day weekend after photos resurfaced online of her participating as a beauty queen in an organization that had historically excluded Black and Jewish people.

Kemper was crowned the ""Veiled Prophet Queen of Love and Beauty"" at a 1999 ball in St. Louis organized by the Veiled Prophet organization, which has racist and elitist origins, according to civil rights activists who frequently picketed the event in the 1960s and '70s.

The then-19-year-old Kemper's association with the organization — a group consisting of wealthy white elites cofounded in 1878 by a former Confederate officer that excluded Black and Jewish people until 1979 — shocked many on Twitter and was a trending topic over two days.

While it was news to a lot of people online, Kemper's involvement in the debutante ball had already been cited on her Wikipedia page and written about before, including in these 2009 and 2010 profiles of Kemper by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, and this 2020 blog post that noted the allegations of racism tied to the event.

A 1999 St. Louis Post-Dispatch file photo showed a smiling Kemper wearing a white gown and gloves and being attended by her ""pages"" after becoming the ""105th young woman"" to be crowned the Veiled Prophet Queen of Love and Beauty at the Adam's Mark hotel in St. Louis.

Kemper, who was attending Princeton University at the time, belongs to a wealthy and influential banking family from St. Louis. She told the Los Angeles Times in 2017 that she had a ""very privileged, nice, warm childhood.""

How YouTubers Become AWFUL Capitalist Bosses and SIMPS for Elon Musk (Mr Beast and David Dobrik),2021-05-29T02:49:00Z,PT28M39S,30789,1634,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"YouTubers have become some of the most popular and successful celebrities, and they often enter this fame and an extremely young ages. Mr Beast, David Dobrik and James Charles are all multi-millionaires with millions of followers and also a sizeable workforce that works on both their YouTube channels and their other business ventures. This is all before the age of 25. 

However, all have also been accused of being awful bosses, either creating toxic workplaces or not paying wages - sometimes both. 

I break down the YouTube capitalist and why they often turn out to be horrible bosses.

"Why Right-Wing Anti-SJWs LOVE Zack Snyder - and how he BETRAYED them (300, Rorschach and Ayn Rand)",2021-05-27T02:30:06Z,PT24M24S,41584,2049,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"#SnyderCut #JusticeLeague

Zack Snyder is a polarising film maker with both a massive fan base and also an army of detractors. The recent #SynderCut fan movement helped see his 4 hours version of Justice League finally released in all its dark glory. But Snyder’s film’s seem to attract a certain element. In a recent Guardian interview, Snyder described himself as a Liberal who votes Democrat, but it is clear he also has some libertarian leanings in his supposed admiration for Ayn Rand. 

However, it is his version of Watchmen, and his adaptation of 300 which are the two most obvious films that draw a right-wing audience. Watchmen flips the character of Rorschach (originally meant to be a satire of the Randian Mr A and the Question) into a dark highly motivated anti-hero, while 300 became a revisionist historical epic that drew in a lot of conservatives of its titanic battle of West vs East. 

We break down Snyder’s politics, the problems with his movies and how he betrayed his fan base.

Southern Pride WORLDWIDE!? The WEIRD Link between Confederate SIMPS + S.Vietnamese Trump Supporters,2021-05-25T02:51:00Z,PT27M21S,19517,967,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"There are two groups of Americans who both feel a sense of loss after a Southern State was defeated by a Northern one. One group is white American Southerners, who decry the tyranny of Abraham Lincoln’s government which defeated the South in the Civil War. The other is Vietnamese-Americans who began their communities across American as refugees fleeing the Communist advance in the final months of the Vietnam War, which ended in a Communist victory in 1975. 

The Southern Americans have recently been comparing their struggle to that of the Vietnamese community, who lean right-wing with most voting Republican and Trump. I break down the similarities and differences with these Simps for states that ended a long time ago.

ABBY SHAPIRO LOVES BIOSHOCK AND RED DEAD 2: How Conservatives Don’t Understand Video Games,2021-05-22T02:50:01Z,PT30M43S,64586,3569,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"This episode is sponsored by Ground News - The world's first news comparison platform. Download Ground News for free: https://ground.news/kavernacle

Abby Shapiro has been working with her Husband’s organisation, the YAF, to livestream video games that promote conservatism. In the promotion for these livestreams, Abby says she is going to expose how progressivism is ruining gaming. The only problem is, the game they have picked to stream is one with a fairly progressive message. The original Bioshock is a direct response to Atlas Shrugged and the general ideology of Ayn Rand, who is influential among the top ranks of the American conservative movement, including Donald Trump and former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. 

For your viewing pleasure I watched 3+ hours of these livestreams to try and see how they attempted to spin Bioshock as a pro-Conservative game. While watching, Red Dead Redemption 2 was also brought up as a potential game to stream as it also has allegedly conservative messaging… Which we will discuss in the video.

Mia Khalifa CALLS OUT Gal Gadot for IDF Service: Celebs backing Palestine vs Celebs backing Israel,2021-05-20T02:32:00Z,PT29M27S,33321,1342,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Mia Khalifa has had an unconventional career path. Raised in Lebanon and moving to the US in 2001, she says she experienced first hand how the conflict in the region can affect its citizens. She has been an outspoken advocate for her home country and recently for the rights of Palestinians. This is in contrast to other celebrities like Gal Gadot and Mr Robot star Carly Chaikin who have either backed Israel's actions or offered the country uncritical solidarity. 

But the world of celebs has been using their platform to raise awareness in Palestine in a way that has never been seen - with the likes of Bella Hadid, Mark Ruffalo, Susan Sarandon, Malala, Paul Pogba, Amad Diallo all showing support.

IGN’s Corporate Owners Quickly REMOVE Staff’s Pro-Palestinian CHARITY Campaign,2021-05-18T02:17:01Z,PT28M7S,7257,553,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"It is hard for ethics in games journalism to exist when giant corporations control the very outlets that are supposed to report the news, including exposing questionable ethical practices. The staff at IGN recently decided to show solidarity to Palestinians, which prompted a swift reprisal by the corporate owners of the outlet. 

The games media industry was attempting to take Palestinain solidarity more seriously after Gamespot editor, Tamoor Hussain, called it out for ignoring the current crisis.

From Washington Post: https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/05/17/ign-palestine-letter-explained/

'Monday afternoon, 66 members of IGN’s staff published a letter decrying the conditions of the article’s removal. “We have come to understand that this was a clear instance of corporate overreach and demonstrated blatant disregard for the most basic standards of journalistic integrity and editorial independence,” the letter states. It was addressed to the publication’s corporate leadership and management at Ziff Davis and J2 Global, the site’s parent company and owner, respectively.

The letter, which demands the reinstatement of the article on IGN’s website, as well as transparency into the decision-making behind the page’s removal and a restated commitment to the staff’s editorial autonomy, is the culmination of a frustrating 24 hours for numerous IGN employees. On Sunday morning, the article linking to charities had been scrubbed from the site with no announcement; the first internal mention came from a post in the site’s Slack, questioning why the link was returning a 404 error.

A day later — following the publication of an official statement and an internal meeting concerning the article’s removal — IGN staff say they still have few answers'","The Kavernacle,Kavernacle,IGN too much water,What does IGN stand for,IGN UK,IGN US,IGN Israel,IGN Palestine,IGN Charity work,IGN workers protest,who owns IGN,who owns IGN Ziff Davies,Who Owns IGN Gamespot,who owns Gamespot,do Gamestop own Game Informer,IGN SJW,IGN Woke,do IGN get paid for reviews?,IGN Paid Reviews,Is IGN better than Gamespot,how to get job at IGN,how to get job at Gamespot,Is working at Gamestop good?",25,148,0
SAM HARRIS LOST TO CENK!? Reviewing the Sam Harris vs Cenk Uygur Debate on Islam - 6 Years later,2021-05-15T02:30:07Z,PT41M16S,21324,1031,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"This episode is sponsored by Ground News - The world's first news comparison platform.

In Intellectual Dark Web lore, this debate made Dave Rubin a conservative grifter. Sam Harris had his moment in the sun in 2014-2016, having high profile debates with multiple people including Ben Affleck. In this specific debate, him and Cenk argued over many different things regarding religion. 

I break down how Harris may have been actually very wrong, and Cenk probably won when all was said and done.

Gal Gadot’s History of endorsing Israeli Warmongering Vs Natalie Portman calling out Israel’s Racism,2021-05-13T02:35:01Z,PT32M3S,88211,3462,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Natalie Portman and Gal Gadot were both born in Israel, but have very different opinions of the actions of the Israeli state. Both have stated they are proud Israelis who love their country, but one has been very critical of its actions, while the other both served in its military between 2004-2006 and also has endorsed Israeli warmongering on multiple occassions. 

I break down their very different relationship with the country of their births.

This is usually from people who hold concerning views about various members of different groups. In this video we break down how ridiculous this is.

The Socialist Politics of Metal Gear Solid and Hideo Kojima - From Che Guevara to Anti-Imperialism,2021-05-08T00:00:04Z,PT30M5S,19235,1414,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"V has come to. 

Metal Gear Solid is one of the most revered and loved video game franchises. Its innovative stealth gameplay and graphics were always complicated by a bizarre and sometimes convoluted narrative.

Behind this narrative were always apparent left-wing political themes. From the snowy walkways of Shadow Moses, to the jungles of Nicaragua and the deserts of Afghanistan, the games have always used the narratives and historical settings as a vehicle to discuss deeper political and philosophical issues.  

This video dissects these themes with a focus on the Big Boss games (3, PW and V)

Iran’s BIGGEST Hitler SIMP! Iranian Nazis who fought in the SS and claimed to be the ‘First Aryans’,2021-05-06T01:00:06Z,PT24M21S,17140,734,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Due to the 1979 Iranian Revolution, our modern perception of Iran is one that see the country as one of the most fundamentalist Islamic in the world, along with Saudi Arabia, but of course it was not always like this. While Muslim, Iran used to be both a more secular monarchy and democracy, where multiple parties existed across the political spectrum. 

There was also a National Socialist Party of Iran called SUMKA. In this video we look at the role of Iranians in WW2, how many joined the SS and how many came back to Iran wanting to create a country like Germany. We will also look at Iranian nationalism that focused on Aryanism, which made the Shah a close ally with Hitler himself.

BEN AFFLECK WAS RIGHT - Sam Harris’s recent history vindicates Ben calling out his Racism,2021-05-04T00:55:01Z,PT34M32S,42256,2279,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Sam Harris vs Ben Affleck is one of the biggest heavyweight intellectual battles since Sam Harris vs Cenk Uyger. The 2014 appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher sparked a heated debate on whether Ben Affleck was a naïve liberal or whether Sam Harris or Bill Maher were bigoted against Muslims. 

While many laughed at Sad-Fleck at the time, it seems he has been vindicated. Sam Harris would go on an anti-BLM crusade while questioning if the US police force were actually racist. He also platformed Charles Murray and had a discussion about the Bell Curve, where Sam Harris would claim there was a direct link between genetics and IQ. In terms of his views on Islam, Harris would go on to say that the Refugee crisis caused by civil wars and Western intervention in North Africa and the Middle East was 'flooding' Europe with 'illiberal' people who were causing Europe's death. All this while ignoring the rise of Far-Right Christian authoritarianism rising in Central and Eastern Europe. 

In terms of Bill Maher, he constantly platforms the worst conservatives on his show where he engages in friendly chats. He also has a bone to pick with the Palestinians, believing that they are at fault for their own oppression, and people only think they are the good guys because they are 'brown' and many Israelis are white. 

It seems, Affleck was right.

How Anti-SJWs HIJACKED The Last Jedi Backlash to SPREAD Far-Right Politics (Rise of Fandom Menace),2021-05-01T03:12:00Z,PT36M34S,30572,1693,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"This episode is sponsored by Ground News - The world's first news comparison platform. Download Ground News for free: https://ground.news/kavernacle

The Sequel Trilogy was widely disliked by fans. Disney’s newest entries to the franchise failed to deliver on multiple fronts, with Rise of Skywalker being an absolute cinematic disaster, with a rushed nonsensical plot. There are many legit criticisms to level at the Sequel films as a whole. 

The Last Jedi was by far the most divisive of the three, with many fans not liking the dialogue or jokes or being miffed with the depiction of fan favourite Luke Skywalker. However, the Anti-SJW reactionaries had another conclusion: the film had been ruined by SJW-leftist-feminist politics and the reason it was so ‘bad’ was because Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson had valued their own politics over the quality of the film. Thus, the Fandom Menace was born. 

Since The Last Jedi, the YouTube community of Star Wars fans have become increasingly indoctrinated into Right-Wing reactionary politics, often believing every single word the fandom menace says, which is often completely made up. 

I break this backlash to the film down and discuss its lasting legacy on the Star Wars community.

He has branched out into other media, with multiple successful animated shows and now a successful movie. However, because DC's Birds of Prey came out a week before the Sonic Movie, and bombed, the blue Hedgehog became a symbol of anti-woke politics for many Anti-SJWs and the right wing. 

I break down this hilarious development.

BBC Reporting (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51487371)

The reviews are in for the new-and-improved Sonic the Hedgehog movie, and the critics have been getting their (human) teeth stuck in. The trailer was out last May, but Sonic went back to the drawing board after fans reacted badly to how he looked. Variety said he ""has been redesigned to satisfy fans, but no-one figured out how to make him as fun as he is fast"".

And IndieWire declared that ""fixing Sonic's terrifying face hasn't made this movie any less of a nightmare"". Jim Carrey plays Dr Robotnik, who - as well as the US government - is chasing the supersonic Sega hedgehog, portrayed in voice and facial motion capture by Ben Schwartz.

The Guardian gave the film two stars, noting how ""dastardly Jim Carrey gives Sonic the blues"". The paper's critic Steve Rose wrote: ""Carrey's moustache-twirling villain is more fun and far more animated than the charmless hero in this derivative caper.""

The Telegraph was similarly unenthused. ""The video game speed freak [is] slowed down to a drab, joyless crawl,"" wrote Robbie Collin. Before he was a movie star, Sonic first appeared as a thrill-seeking Sega video game character in the early-90s. The New York Times concluded that the ""Sega adaptation hedges its bets"". Ben Kenigsberg wrote: ""Improvements to Sonic's appearance haven't done much for a generic script.""","The Kavernacle,Kavernacle,Sonic movie,sonic sjws,sonic birds of prey,sonic 2 knucles,sonic the hedgehog 2006,sonic worst game ever,is the Sonic movie good,sonic movie review,when is the second sonic movie coming out,will knuckles be in the second sonic movie,will tails be in the second sonic movie,was birds of prey bad,is Harley Quinn good ?,Is Jared Leto coming back as Joker,is the synder cut good ?,Geeks and gamers",25,552,0

Weirdly, in their announcement they said they would stay true to Anglo-Saxon political traditions, a kingdom that met its end in 1066 at the hands of William the Conqueror from Normandy, who eventually conquered the whole of England, essentially wiping out the Anglo-Saxon political establishment across the country.  

But why would these congressmen and women include this language? In this video we look at the history of Americans using the term Anglo-Saxon, the history of this term being used to push exclusionary politics and why it requires revisionist history to even belief it in the first place.

https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5gpqj/marjorie-taylor-greene-matt-gaetz-launch-anglo-saxon-america-first-caucus

A group of the House’s most extreme right-wing Republicans is launching a new caucus to push President Trump’s values—and an explicit pledge to push “Anglo-Saxon political traditions.”

Scandal-plagued Florida GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz announced he was joining Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s new “America First Caucus” group on Friday, just hours after a draft memo leaked that outlined the organization’s barely veiled racism.

The seven-page memo states the group has been formed “to follow in President Trump’s footsteps, and potentially step on some toes and sacrifice sacred cows for the good of the American nation.”

The memo was first obtained by Punchbowl News, which reported that Arizona Republican Rep. Paul Gosar is also involved in the group’s founding and that Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert and Alabama Rep. Barry Moore were also planning to join.","The Kavernacle,Kavernacle,Anglo Saxons,Anglo Saxon Matt Gaetz,Anglo Saxon Marjorie Taylor Greene,Who were the Anglo Saxons,were the anglo saxons germans,when did the anglo saxons conquer england,when did the Normans conquer england,who was Alfred the Great,was alfred the great the best king of england,who were the anglo saxons,Anglo Saxons america first,how did the Normans beat the Saxons,who was Rollo the viking,is Matt Gaetz guilty ?",25,1071,0
DEBUNKING Conservatives who think Hideo Kojima is a Nationalist who HATES Che Guevara,2021-04-17T01:41:01Z,PT25M50S,28954,1677,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"The Metal Gear Solid franchise is probably one of the most overtly political in gaming. It is also explicitly anti-imperialist, anti-authoritarian and often anti-capitalist too. The 2010 entry, Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker, also has many of the central characters (Big Boss, Miller and Amanda) fanboy over the iconic socialist revolutionary. 

However, in my video analysing how Right Wingers do not understand video games, many stated that Kojima was actually using Big Boss's praise of Che to depict him as the villain. Which is ridiculous. 

In this 'comment comeback' video, I respond to these arguments and address them.

The most recent conflict came in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea and backed Russian Separatists in Eastern Ukraine. Many mercenaries across the world travelled to the region to fight for both sides. However, the strong presence of Fascist Militias fighting for the Ukrainian side attracted the Western Alt-Right. 

In this video we dive into the history of Ukrainian fascism and talk about tis current iteration.

BBC reporting: 
Why is Russia at war with Ukraine?
Russian-Ukrainian relations now are certainly hostile, but it is not all-out war. There are sporadic clashes on the front line.

Since the collapse of communism in 1991, Russian troops have intervened in conflicts in several areas of the former Soviet Union, notably in Chechnya and other parts of the Caucasus.

In April 2014, just after Russia's annexation of Crimea, pro-Russian separatists seized a large swathe of eastern Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Earlier, months of pro-Western demonstrations in Ukraine's capital Kyiv had forced out a pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych.

Mr Kuleba recalled that in 2014 there was a Russian plan to split Ukraine and create an entity called ""Novorossiya"" (New Russia) - a plan foiled by Ukraine's armed forces.

The conflict zone, known as Donbas, is mainly Russian-speaking and now many of its residents have Russian passports. President Putin says Russia will defend Russian citizens abroad, if they are seen to be at risk.

Russia's use of special forces, cyberwarfare and propaganda in this and other conflicts is known as ""hybrid warfare"" - not a hot war, but not a frozen conflict either. A US special report for Congress last year highlighted the role of the GRU, Russia's military intelligence agency.

There was large-scale combat in 2014, before a ceasefire in 2015. There have been some prisoner exchanges since then.

More than 13,000 people have been killed in the conflict. Ukraine says 26 of its troops have died in Donbas so far this year, compared to 50 in all of 2020. The separatists say more than 20 of theirs have died this year.","The Kavernacle,Kavernacle,Why is Russia fighting Ukraine,is Crimea russia,is crimea a part of ukraine,is Crimea a part of Russia,is there a conflict between Russia and Ukraine,is there a war between Russia and Ukraine,who controls Eastern Ukraine,Is Eastern Ukraine Russia,is Eastern Ukraine Ukrainian,Is Ukraine in NATO,is Ukraine in the European Union,Alt Right Ukraine,What is the Azov,what is Azov ukraine",25,464,0
The Rise of Western Chauvinism - From New Atheism to the Proud Boys (Sam Harris/Gavin McInnes),2021-04-13T02:00:06Z,PT29M46S,29721,1460,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"New Atheism rose to prominence in the wake of 9/11. Samuel Huntington's Clash of Civilisation had become the doctrine of the day, and Hitchens, Harris and Dawkins targeted the Islamic majority countries as wars with the West raged across the Middle East and Central Asia. The appeal to the far right is apparent, but the continued obsessive focus on Islam has often made the movement a pipeline to more radical views. At the very least, in terms of Islam and immigration from MENA, the goals of the two groups align. 

This video analyses the rise of explicit Western Chauvinism, and how the rhetoric of New Atheism is not too dissimilar to those exposed by the founder of the Proud Boys - Gavin McInnes.

"The Problem with Ethics in Games Journalism isn't FEMINISM - It's CAPITALISM (GamerGate, IGN, Anita)",2021-04-10T02:13:00Z,PT30M14S,18922,1071,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Ethic in games journalism was a popular motto for gamers to cry from 2012-2016. It is largely focused on the growth of outspoken progressive games critics and game developers. Some also touched on the uneasy corporate influence in video games journalism, however this was not the focus of the movement. 

In this video, I analyse how capitalism is the actual factor that compromises ethics in video games.

Jordan Peterson Finds Out The New Red Skull is BASED ON HIM Causing Anti-SJWs to MELTDOWN,2021-04-08T01:07:01Z,PT21M58S,45182,2268,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Jordan Peterson has a massive flock of followers of impressionable young men who he influences with his controversial philosophy and politics. Recently he discovered the new Red Skull in Marvel's Captain America comic series is actually based on him and his work. 

I break down the controversy and how Peterson is actually a good inspiration for a character like the Red Skull.

I am sorry I have disappointed the people who care about me. I hold myself accountable for my actions. Death Stranding is not a walking simulator. I will do better in the future. Do not defend my actions. I apologies to everyone I hurt. Game of Thrones was never good. This will never happen again. 

Have you ever heard any of the above? Well then you have probably heard a YouTuber apology. Where YouTubers caught in a scandal will humble themselves before their audience and beg for forgiveness. This happens in more when sponsors start to drop your favourite e-celebs! 

Today we are talking about YouTubers and their manufactured apologies and how their cult of personalities allow them to get away from actual accountability.

"The WEIRD World of Alt-Right TikTok - Online Fascist SIMPS for Mosley, Mussolini and Pinochet",2021-03-30T02:00:04Z,PT21M59S,27813,1450,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"TikTok has exploded as an app online over the last couple years. It has been mired in controversy due to allegations it is sharing personal data with the Chinese government, but it still remains a popular place for cringey dance videos and for teenagers to post vain videos of themselves posing. 

TikTok also has some pretty good filters that don't allow fascist content. However, it seems this only applies to Nazi Germany, as typing in figures like Mussolini, Oswald Mosley, General Pinochet and co will bring you a whole host of Alt-Right TikTok. In this video I take a look into this community and the relative ease in how they get around the TikTok censors.

KSI follows PewDiePie and QUITS Twitter after Transphobia Controversy BLAMING 'Cancel Culture',2021-03-27T02:30:02Z,PT20M11S,16835,927,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"KSI is the darling of British YouTube and is by the far the UK's most successful creator, having both a massive presence on YouTube personally and as part of the Sidemen. He quit Twitter this week because of supposed 'cancel culture' saying that PewDiePie was also right to leave the site for similar reasons... 

However, KSI has been in hot water lately for controversial stuff. I break down this issue, and how people like to say they are 'cancelled' for being held responsible for their actions. I also talk about the same tactic Gina Carano said.

How Anti-SJWs Create Bizarre FALSE NARRATIVES To Justify their Political Positions and Clickbait,2021-03-25T03:00:04Z,PT24M2S,23239,1502,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"To live in the world of the anti-SJWs, you have to believe in a lot of made up stuff. I have previously said that these channels make fan fiction out of real life, because if they just told the news as it was, it would be impossible to justify their clickbait content. 

Brie Larson making a Star Wars series directed by Kathleen Kennedy? George Lucas - who sold Star Wars years ago - apparently firing Kathleen Kennedy? Civil War in Lucasfilm between Dave Filoni and Jon Favreau vs Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson? Gal Gadot apparently owning Brie Larson with facts and logic? Zack Snyder being a crusader against the Left? Well you have to believe all these things and more if you want to be apart of the Anti-SJW community!

Two and a Half Men Creator’s TONE-DEAF Afghan Interpreter Sitcom will SANITISE US War in Afghanistan,2021-03-23T02:30:31Z,PT21M8S,10413,560,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Do you love Two and a Half Men? Well there is a new show coming out just for you. Produced and created by Chuck Lorre and Reza Aslan, the new buddy buddy sitcom sees one of the very few Afghan interpreters who make it past the gruelling vetting process to enter the US, stay with the family of an American Veteran who fought in the US-led war in Afghanistan... and wacky hijinks ensue! 

I break down the trailer, the social media reaction, the cast and crew working on the show and the very real issue of Afghan interpreters failing to escape the danger they are in at home for helping the US, who then make it very difficult for them to flee to America.

USA Today reporting: https://eu.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2021/03/22/chuck-lorre-cbs-sitcom-united-states-of-al-backlash/4795934001/

A new trailer for writer/producer Chuck Lorre's upcoming CBS sitcom ""The United States of Al"" is facing backlash for the casting and portrayal of a U.S. military interpreter from Afghanistan.

Set to premiere April 1, ""Al"" centers on the friendship between Riley (Parker Young), an ex-Marine attempting to adjust to life outside of the service, and his unit's interpreter, Awalmir, aka Al (Adhir Kalyan).

In a series of tweets over the weekend, executive producer Reza Aslan urged critics to ""speak from facts, not feelings"" and wait until they see the full show before forming an opinion. 

""The only way you will no longer be underrepresented on TV is if people like me try to do something about it. And people like you support it,"" Aslan, who was born in Iran, tweeted Saturday in response to critics. “My whole life I’ve been misrepresented on TV. That’s why I came to Hollywood to change that. You don’t have to support the effort. But maybe watch it then (expletive) on it not other way round.""

USA TODAY has reached out to Lorre and CBS for further comment. 

Many on social media took issue with the fact that Kalyan is not Afghan but plays one in the show. Aslan noted on Twitter that four of the five Afghan characters on the show are played by Afghans.

""I crave Muslim content but this is offensive,"" tweeted ""General Hospital"" actress Maysoon Zayid.

""I know @rezaaslan has other producing credits, and I honestly believe his heart *was* in the right place,"" tweeted Broadway performer Pia Glenn. ""But at some point the decision presented itself to make some CBS sitcom (expletive) OR a show honoring Afghan soldiers, and he chose the former.""

""We saw 100 Afghan leads but sitcom is a specialized genre and it’s very tough to play,"" Aslan wrote. ""But we also have four Afghan writers/producers on the show who’ve done a great job helping Adhir.""","The Kavernacle,Kavernacle,United States of Al,United States of Al Controversy,United States of Al Afghanistan,United states of al chuck lorre,two and a half men,two and a half men real ending,two and a half men ending charlie,why did charlie sheen get fired from two and a half men,charlie sheen platoon,charlie sheen chuck lorre,did chuck lorre and charlie sheen fall out,afghanistan interpreters chuck lorre,two and a half men united states of al",25,217,0
Zack Snyder CALLS OUT Geeks + Gamers and Anti-SJWs for Spreading 'Hate' on THEIR OWN LIVESTREAM,2021-03-20T02:00:03Z,PT19M1S,56522,3042,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Zack Snyder has become somewhat of an Anti-SJW icon. These reactionaries have led the charge on the Snyder cut, a re-cut longer version of 2017's Justice League. They have seen Snyder as a man who has stood up to both Warner Bros and film critics to release his own vision. They recently had Snyder on a livestream... and it did not go well. And the meltdown has been enjoyable to say the least.

"How China is NOT Ruining Your Video Games and Films: CAPITALISM is (Activision, Marvel and Tencent)",2021-03-16T03:00:10Z,PT25M16S,14108,1047,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Gamers have constantly found rallying causes for a lot of their anger. Whether that be microtransactions and loot boxes, or battle passes and DLC. Another issue gamers have united around is a anger towards the Chinese Communist Party, the rulers of the one-party system in the People's Republic Of China. To them the Chinese government are acting through Chinese corporations to enact hostile takeovers of Western companies like Epic or Activision for the sole purpose of pushing state propaganda. Tencent is the main villain in this narrative. 

However, this is not exactly the truth. There is actually growing hostility between the Communist Party in China and the new entrepreneurial class embodied by publicly traded Chinese companies like Tencent, who are not owned by the state. But the heart of the issue is that the reason more Western films and games are being designed to abide by Chinese Censorship is because Western capitalist corporations want all the money. Not satisfied with the billions of revenue they rake in Western and Eastern markets, Hollywood and the main gaming corporations want ALL the money, regardless if that significantly eats in to the artistic direction of their products.

This video primarily focuses on debunking arguments against Hideo Kojima's work having Leftist messages and themes and also asks why Conservatives are so hesitant to discuss the blatant and obvious critique of Ayn Rand style capitalism in Bioshock.

How RACISM Directed at Meghan Markle Made BEN SHAPIRO and CHARLIE KIRK Support the British Monarchy,2021-03-11T03:00:16Z,PT24M28S,16111,1173,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Meghan Markle recently described the overt and subtle racism she experience as Princess in the UK's Royal Family. Many have accused of lying and American 'Patriots' Charlie Kirk and Ben Shapiro have announced she must be lying because both do not believe the Monarchy could be racist...

I break down their ridiculous arguments and discuss the long history of the racism present in the British Royal Family.

Troy Leavitt is a veteran game developer, primarily working on games for young children including many licensed Disney games, including Toy Story 3 as well as being a Director of Disney Infinity. Troy joined Avalanche in 2018, and the studio is working on Warner Bros in creating an Original Harry Potter open world game set before the movies. 

Troy also used to spend time on his hobby, YouTube. This is where he would create gaming content centred around his politics. Troy is an anti-feminist who believes the systemic racism and sexism do not actually exist and GamerGate was righteous in its targeting of several journalists like Anita Sarkeesian, who is often a focus of Troy's videos. 

I break down Troy's problematic beliefs and why him being in a position of power over Avalanche employees is troubling.

Kotaku Reporting: 

Troy Leavitt is a lead designer at Warner Bros. development studio Avalanche Software currently working on controversial Harry Potter game Hogwarts Legacy. He also ran a reactionary YouTube channel focused on attacking feminism and social justice for over a year.

This information was first provided by Did You Know Gaming? contributor Liam Robertson, who highlighted the channel Friday evening on Twitter. An accompanying screenshot shows a small portion of Leavitt’s YouTube channel, with video titles such as “The Injustice of Social Justice,” “In Praise of Cultural Appropriation,” and “Are Thoughtcrimes Becoming Real,” the latter a reference to George Orwell’s dystopic sci-fi novel 1984. Right-wing commentators often use the book’s authoritarian “Big Brother” government as a comparison point in their criticism, likening the fictional surveillance state to real-world equality movements.

Among Leavitt’s other videos are lengthy defenses of both John Lasseter, the Pixar co-founder who left his position at Disney in 2017 after allegations of sexual misconduct, and Nolan Bushnell, the Atari co-founder who Kotaku’s reporting found to have fostered a toxic work environment for women. In some of his videos, Leavitt expressed support for Gamergate, a movement that fostered harassment against women and other minorities in the gaming industry, and criticized Anita Sarkeesian’s Tropes vs. Women series as an “uninformed fringe position.” Leavitt discussed his opinions on Gamergate in-depth during a 2017 interview, saying, “Gamergate, while painful at times, on the whole proved to be a good thing,”

A veteran developer, Leavitt got his start as a consultant on games like 1996’s Twisted Metal 2 and 1997’s Jet Moto 2, eventually moving onto a long stint at Disney. He contributed to a variety of licensed games and directed several Disney Infinity expansions before leaving the company in July 2016.

Leavitt published his first video to his YouTube channel in September 2016, sharing a steady stream of content until his last upload in May 2018. It’s since accrued over 24,000 subscribers and 2 million total views. While the channel hasn’t been active recently, Leavitt’s Twitter profile still links to it, alongside his status as a Hogwarts Legacy developer. In one video, Leavitt claims that he made his employers at Warner Bros. aware of the channel after being hired at Avalanche Software in February 2018 and that they didn’t seem too worried about its content.

https://www.ign.com/articles/six-days-in-fallujah-is-not-trying-to-make-a-political-commentary-about-the-iraqi-war

According to Six Days in Fallujah's publisher Victura, the recently resurrected military FPS based on a real Iraq War battle is not attempting to ""make a political commentary about whether or not the war itself was a good or a bad idea.”

Peter Tamte, the head of Six Days in Fallujah publisher Victura, spoke to Polygon after the game was re-announced for a 2021 release, and stated that developer Highwire Games ""will not grapple with the political machinations that led to the titular conflict."" Instead, the game's focus will be to ""engender empathy"" for the American troops, their work in taking out the insurgents throughout Fallujah, and the civilians who were caught in between.

“I think reasonable people can disagree with that,” Tamte told Polygon of his narrative strategy. “For us as a team, it is really about helping players understand the complexity of urban combat. It’s about the experiences of that individual that is now there because of political decisions. And we do want to show how choices that are made by policymakers affect the choices that [a Marine] needs to make on the battlefield. Just as that [Marine] cannot second-guess the choices by the policymakers, we’re not trying to make a political commentary about whether or not the war itself was a good or a bad idea.”

Six Days in Fallujah isn't the first game to attempt to sidestep politics, as The Division 2's developer Ubisoft Massive also revealed that it didn't want to take a stance in current politics and that doing so would be ""bad for business, unfortunately."" Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney also argued that politics should be removed from game companies.

The difference between The Division 2 and Six Days in Fallujah, however, is that the Iraq War is an event that is pulled right from our world, as opposed to a fictional tale of war.

The city of Fallujah saw increased insurgent activity during the 2003 Iraq War when a terrorist named Abu Musab al-Zarqawi brought in fighters from around the country and beyond to the city. In the months and years that followed, Fallujah saw a ton of civilian casualties and the death of a team of private military contractors from Blackwater USA.

In 2004, Western forces made two attempts to retake the city, and Six Days in Fallujah focuses on this Second Battle of Fallujah which, according to the International Red Cross, cost around 100 American lives and the lives of at least 800 civilians.","The Kavernacle,Kavernacle,Six Days in Fallujah,Six Days in Fallujah Political,Six Days in Fallujah Controversy,Six Days in Fallujah 2021,Six Days in Fallujah Iraq War,Six Days in Fallujah release date,when does Six Days in Fallujah come out?,Why was Six Days in Fallujah cancelled?,Why are games political,SJWs political games,Uranium Depleted Rounds,Iraq,Why did the US invade Iraq,Why did the US invade Afghanistan",25,361,0

First gaining mainstream prominence with Blade Runner in 1982, the rain and neon soaked streets of this Californian dystopia have inspired multiple works of fiction in Manga, anime, comic books, TV, films and video games. 

However, it comes loaded with a host of several problems. This video analyses the problematic tropes, the American-Japanese Politics of the 1980's that seeped into this fiction and how it still rears its head today.

https://deadline.com/2021/02/gina-carano-mandalorian-ben-shapiro-hits-back-cancel-culture-1234692971/

Social media posts by Gina Carano, who plays Cara Dune on The Mandalorian, have been called ""abhorrent and unacceptable"" by Lucasfilm.

In a statement, a spokesperson said: ""Gina Carano is not currently employed by Lucasfilm and there are no plans for her to be in the future.""

The hashtag #FireGinaCarano trended on Twitter for hours following a story shared on her Instagram, that some branded anti-Semitic.

It has since been deleted.

In the post, the former MMA fighter compared ""hating someone for their political views"" in the US to the treatment of Jewish people during the Holocaust in Nazi Germany.

Millions of Jewish people and other minorities were killed at the hands of the Nazis during World War Two.

EXCLUSIVE: Less than 24 hours after her explosive ouster from Star Wars series The Mandalorian for incendiary social media posts, Gina Carano has hit back at her detractors and revealed a new movie project she is making with conservative website The Daily Wire.

Carano told us today: “The Daily Wire is helping make one of my dreams — to develop and produce my own film — come true. I cried out and my prayer was answered. I am sending out a direct message of hope to everyone living in fear of cancellation by the totalitarian mob. I have only just begun using my voice which is now freer than ever before, and I hope it inspires others to do the same. They can’t cancel us if we don’t let them.”

Dank Farrik, as her Mandalorian character would say.

Carano will develop, produce, and star in the upcoming film, which The Daily Wire says it will release exclusively to its members as the company looks to bolster its entertainment division. Details are being kept under wraps but it will be produced as part of Daily Wire’s partnership with Bone Tomahawk producer Dallas Sonnier and his Bonfire Legend banner.

“We could not be more excited to be working with Gina Carano, an incredible talent dumped by Disney and Lucasfilm for offending the authoritarian Hollywood Left. This is what Daily Wire exists to do: provide an alternative not just for consumers, but for creators who refuse to bow to the mob,” said Daily Wire co-founder Shapiro.

“We’re eager to bring Gina’s talent to Americans who love her, and we’re just as eager to show Hollywood that if they want to keep cancelling those who think differently, they’ll just be helping us build the Xwing to take down their Death Star,” he added.

Carano’s controversial social media posts, described by Lucasfilm as “abhorrent”, saw her turfed from The Mandalorian by the studio and ditched by her agency UTA. The former MMA star and Deadpool actress played bounty hunter Cara Dune on the first two seasons of Lucasfilm and Disney+’s hit series.

The actress raised hell by sharing a TikTok post comparing the current divided political climate in the U.S. to Nazi Germany.

“Jews were beaten in the streets, not by Nazi soldiers but by their neighbors…even by children. Because history is edited, most people today don’t realize that to get to the point where Nazi soldiers could easily round up thousands of Jews, the government first made their own neighbors hate them simply for being Jews. How is that any different from hating someone for their political views,” she wrote.","The Kavernacle,Kavernacle,Why has Gina Carano been cancelled,Gina Carano fired,Fire Gina Carano,Gina Carano quartering,Gina Carano geeks and gamers,Gina Carano Ben Shapiro,Why was Gina Carano fired,Gina Carano Mandalorian fired,Quartering,Geeks and gamers Star Wars,Quartering Gina Carano Fire,Cancel culture Gina Carano,Cancel culture conservatives,Cancel culture quartering,Lucasfilm,Why was she fired from the Mandalorian,Gina Carano fired cancelled,Carano mando",25,1647,0

They are also very angry that the majority white South African army got defeated by the Cuban Army and Angolan Communists multiple times.

I also discuss why Gal Gadot causes controversy, highlighted by her being cast as Cleopatra, with many in Egypt finding it controversial as she served in the IDF during the war with Lebanon in 2006, and supported the 2014 invasion of Gaza.

The WEIRD World of Wehraboos - Reddit Simps for the Nazi Military and Rommel (Wehrmacht Myths),2021-02-06T02:15:05Z,PT23M52S,55313,2427,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"WW2 was the most destructive conflict in human history, and is one of the most popular subjects to study in history. There are many fan communities across sites on Reddit. However, due to the western-centric of both Reddit and WW2 studies in the west, many are places that see many spout revisionist history about the innocence of groups like the Wehrmacht and the nobility of people like Rommel.

This video goes through some of the most popular myths spouted by the Wehraboo and debunks some popular myths around the War and the reasons this reckoning history became so widespread.

Why the Alt-Right LOVE the r/WallStreetBets GameStop Stock Movement,2021-02-02T02:30:03Z,PT16M45S,8347,496,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"The drive to buy GameStop Stock to hurt the hedge fund Melvin Capital has been led by the subreddit r/WallStreetBets. It is a broad movement encompassing many different political ideologies. The subreddit itself is not alt-right or far-right, although due to the nature of trading, it does seem to be right-leaning. 

However, the far-right do like what is happening at the moment. An economic attack on Wall Street can be helpful in indoctrinating people into fascist conspiracy theories about the nature of global finance and who really controls America's stocks and financial fortune.

Jimmy Dore has long been a recognisable face in the alt-media world of YouTube. Orignally beginning his own show as part of the TYT network, Dore eventually split a couple years back, finding success as a solo act. 

In this video we look at how Dore's takes became more conspiratorial as he became more toxic and broke ties with progressives he once called friends - up until his recent video giving a softball interview to an accelerationist member of the Boogaloo Boys.

Independent reporting: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/gamestop-share-price-reddit-hedge-fund-melvin-capital-b1793543.html

A $13bn hedge fund has been left with huge losses after an army of amateur investors coordinating via social media pumped up the price of video game retailer GameStop tenfold in just a few weeks.

Melvin Capital had bet against GameStop by short-selling its shares, meaning it stood to gain if the price went down and lose if it went up.

Members of the Reddit thread “wallstreetbets” decided to pile in to GameStop with the aim of pushing up the share price to inflict losses on short-sellers including Melvin Capital.

The move, known as “squeezing the shorts”, saw GameStop’s shares surge from a little over $17 at the start of the year to almost $150 when trading closed on Tuesday.  

It then more than doubled again in after-hours trading after Tesla boss Elon Musk,  who has had his own battles with short-sellers in the past, tweeted to his 42 million followers “Gamestonk!”.

Hedge funds and others that bet against GameStop have collectively lost more than $5bn, Melvin Capital boss Gabe Plotkin told CNBC that his fund had closed its position in GameStop on Tuesday. That came after Melvin Capital’s backers Citadel and Point72 pumped almost $3bn into the fund to keep it afloat.according to data analytics company S3. Another short-seller, Citron Research, was also stung by GameStop’s meteoric rise. Citron boss Andrew Left told Bloomberg he had covered most of his short position “at a loss of 100 per cent”.

Some Reddit users boasted of significant returns, having bought GameStop shares or options for less than $20.

GameStop shares dropped sharply from more than $340 in after-hours trading to $250 on Wednesday morning in New York before recovering to $320. The price had been as low as $6 at points last year and GameStop is not forecast to make a profit until at least 2023. 

Amateur investors face big losses when the shares eventually return to something approaching a rational valuation based on the company’s prospects and ability to make money.

The episode has ignited debate about the ethics and legality of social media users joining together to inflate stock prices. 

Fund manager Michael Burry warned that GameStop’s share price was out of control, tweeting that the situation was “unnatural, insane, and dangerous”.

In a now-deleted post he said that there should be “legal and regulatory repercussions”. Mr Burry, who gained notoriety after being portrayed by Christian Bale in Hollywood movie The Big Short,  reportedly made a 15-fold return on his own fund’s investment in GameStop. 

Reddit traders have now turned their attention to another struggling company, cinema chain AMC. Its share price jumped 200 per cent in early trading on Wednesday after a flurry of social media posts calling for investors to buy the stock.","The Kavernacle,Kavernacle,WallStreetBets,r/wallstreetbets,wallstreetbets gamestop,wallstreetbets melvin capital,wallstreetbets gamestop stock,gamestop stocks,why is gamestop stock so high,who is wallstreebets,what is melvin capital,what are wallstreetbets doing,wallstreetbets amc,why is amc stock so high,why are people buying gamestop stock,why are people buying amc stock,Robinhood,Robinhood lawsuit,Robinhood gamespot,Robinhood AMC",25,236,0

The Anti-SJW channels of YouTube promptly made several videos on her tweets and new role at Disney prompting a widespread racist harassment campaign. Disney stood by her which only outraged the anti-SJWs further. 

I break it down in this video.

Krystina Arielle: Star Wars supports High Republic host after racist abuse
(https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-55782460)

The official Star Wars Twitter account has tweeted in support for Krystina Arielle, the host of the upcoming Star Wars: The High Republic Show, after she received online harassment.

Tweets by Arielle surfaced of her speaking about the role white people play in upholding racism.

She then started receiving racist abuse, and accusations of being racist.

But Star Wars tweeted in support of her, stating: ""Our Star Wars community is one of hope and inclusivity"".

Ms Arielle was recently announced as the host of The High Republic Show, an upcoming web series about Star Wars: The High Republic, a new subseries of the Star Wars media franchise.

She came under attack after social media users resurfaced numerous old tweets, mostly from last year when protests were taking place around the world in support of Black Lives Matter.

""The last 24 hours have been ... not the greatest,"" she tweeted on Saturday, along with screenshots of highly offensive, racist messages.

But many have spoken out in support of Arielle, while the hashtag #IStandWithKrystina started trending on Twitter.

Matthew Mercer, host of the Critical Role podcast, which has featured her, said: ""There are few as bright, badass and altogether wonderful as [Krystina Arielle], and anyone who tries to step into her ring better know we're right there beside her.""

This is not the first time someone involved in the Star Wars franchise has reported receiving racist abuse.

Actor John Boyega said his casting in The Force Awakens elicited a blatantly racist backlash from some fans.

""Nobody else had the uproar and death threats sent to their Instagram DMs and social media, saying, 'Black this and black that and you shouldn't be a Stormtrooper,'"" he told British GQ last year.

""Nobody else had that experience. But yet people are surprised that I'm this way. That's my frustration.""


In some of her past tweets, Arielle references white people while giving opinions on systemic racism. In one, she states: ""Just a reminder that white women are just as complicit in upholding and enforcing white supremacy.""","The Kavernacle,Kavernacle,Star Wars the High Republic,Star Wars the High Republic SJWS,Star Wars the High Republic sjw white,star wars the high republic host,star wars the high republic anti white,star wars the high republic kathleen kennedy,kathleen kennedy ruining star wars,who is kathleen kennedy,high republic sjws,high republic anti white,krystina arielle,krystina arielle high republic,star wars,thequartering,the quartering sjws,the quartering brie larson",25,1128,0

YouTube political news has long been dominated by the Right-Wing. The platform itself has many rules and set out code of conduct, yet when it comes to enforcing these rules many of the larger conservative channels continually and constantly get let off the hook. 

In this video, we look at Ben Shapiro, Tim Pool, Dave Rubin and discuss how much toxicity and bigotry they allow on their platform and how it acts as the radical ideology found at the end of the YT pipeline.

We also look at more contemporary fascist groups that are Satanists and what they believe.

Why so many Neo-Nazis are Environmentalists (The History of Eco-Fascism),2021-01-14T04:15:01Z,PT21M10S,20756,1254,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"In mainstream politics, environmental issues are usually led by the left wing. However, since the turn of the 20th century, significant white supremacist movements have taken up the cause of environmental rights with their own racist spin. 

I break down the history of eco-fascism and how it is still an issue today in global politics.

A surprisingly common experience, this has its roots in the rise of online Anime culture which started in Japan in the early 2000s. This videos looks at the roots of nationalism in the anime community and the problems the source material itself sometimes has.

The Gay Fascists of the Alt-Right and the History of Gay Nazis (From Ernst Rohm to Milo),2021-01-07T03:00:04Z,PT20M1S,74119,3863,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Ersnt Rohm was the leader of the Brownshirts in 1930's Germany, and was also a close ally of Hitler. He helped show a young Adolf the ropes in the party. Rohm was also out as a gay man, which prompted attacks from within and outside the Nazi Party. He was eventually purged during the Night of the Long Knives. Rohm himself seems like a paradox, but rationalised his sexual orientation by thinking of the Ancient Spartans who were often involved romantically with eachother. If being gay could be extremely masculine, then it was compatible with fascism in Rohm's view. 

This belief is the through line throughout the last 100 years of fascist history, where multiple gay men have been leading figures in far-right movements, including the modern day alt-right. This video analyses the history and the ideology of a group of people seemingly at odds with the political views they subscribe too.

A controversial marketing campaign for Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War featuring Yuri Bezmenov and Ronald Reagan made many believe that the latest entry would be no different. 

Of course Black Ops Cold War features many of the typical tropes found in Western FPS games. However, it is a suprising entry that both depicts the CIA in a bad light and attempts to humanise the Soviet Union.

How ‘Classically Abby’ Shapiro pushes toxic politics to appeal to Ben Shapiro’s fanbase,2020-12-19T02:00:06Z,PT21M21S,21714,1036,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Classical Abby is Ben Shapiro's sister. She has become notorious on YouTube after paying for the social media company to promote her videos to thousands, often using one of her politics videos as the one that was promoted. Her channel is a mixture of vlogs, advice on life as well as conservative politics. However, the latter feels like it is only a part of her content due to her trying to get the audience who also watch her brother. These videos are the most disliked and receive the most negative comments. They also come off as scripted and unnatural. 

I break down her content and why I think she should stick to the other types of videos she makes, which come across more natural and like things she actually cares about.

This also extends to Ben Shapiro. While many like his bigoted views and takes, the alt-right do not like his religion or his support for Israel.

It promised to be the next big thing but couldn't even fulfil basic necessities like shelter and food. 

Cyberpunk 2077 released glitchy and broken on last generation systems (PS4/Xbox One) despite promises that it worked 'surprisingly well' according to CD Projekt Red. Not only this, but the company had been making claims about the features that would be included in the game but it was later found even basic elements like NPC cycles and Police AI were not present in the game.

Samuel Huntington's Clash of Civilisation had become the doctrine of the day, and Hitchens, Harris and Dawkins targeted the Islamic majority countries as wars with the West raged across the Middle East and Central Asia. The appeal to the far right is apparent, but the continued obsessive focus on Islam has often made the movement a pipeline to the Alt-Right. At the very least, in terms of Islam and immigration from MENA, the goals of the two groups align.

This was a direct cause of his addiction to Xanax's and other prescription drugs. However, if you listened to Peterson on one of his numerous seminars, he beliefs that through personal accountability addiction can be overcome. Like many Conservatives, the emphasis is on the individual and he often ignored or minimised socio-economic factors. In this video, I show how Peterson could not follow his own advice, and he himself was a victim of external factors.

Independent reporting: ""Jordan Peterson has been forced to pursue “emergency” drug detox treatment in Russia after getting hooked on highly addictive psychoactive anti-anxiety drugs, his daughter has said.

The Canadian psychologist, who has attracted a substantial far-right following, has withdrawn from the public eye due to his spiralling addiction to benzodiazepines.

Withdrawal symptoms of benzodiazepines, which include Valium, Xanex and others, include acute anxiety, panic attacks, vomiting, insomnia, muscle twitches, headaches, paranoia, memory loss and in the most extreme instances seizures which can cause death.

Peterson’s daughter, Mikhaila Peterson, said his physical dependence on benzodiazepine tranquilisers first became clear to his family last April when his wife of 30 years, Tammy, was diagnosed with terminal cancer.

The controversial academic had been consuming the drug for years to alleviate persistent anxiety in the wake of a severe autoimmune reaction to food.""","The Kavernacle,Kavernacle,Jordan Peterson,Who IS Jordan Peterson,Jordan Peterson addiction,Jordan Peterson Benzos,Jordan Peterson Xanax,Jordan Peterson Daughter,Jordan Peterson Joe Rogan,Jordan Peterson Dave Rubin,Jordan Peterson Feminism,Jordan Peterson H3H3,Jordan Peterson Marxism,Jordan Peterson Marx,Jordan Peterson Does not Understand Marxism,Opioid Crisis",25,578,0

A community that constantly promoted the agenda of the President as well as spread wild racist conspiracy theories about white replacement and deep state operations. It also promoted and urged its followers to attend the Unite the Right Charlottesville rally and acknowledged that they would be allying themselves with National Socialists.

Wired reporting:  Reddit has banned r/The_Donald. Who it bans next matters more

Since 2015, more than 790,000 people have congregated over at the r/The_Donald subreddit, posting memes, videos and messages in support of their hero, US then-presidential candidate and current president Donald Trump – who does not support the group but once blessed it with an Ask Me Anything – and debating head-scratchers like “is there a difference between white nationalism and white supremacy?”

On Monday, Reddit decided to take action. r/The_Donald is no more. The ban results from an update to Reddit’s hate speech policies. Users must now abide by eight new rules, which prohibit, among other things, targeted harassment and revealing the identities of others. r/The_Donald, along with 2,000 other mainly dormant communities, including a subreddit for the fans of leftwing podcast Chapo Trap House, fell foul of these new standards, which require users to “remember the human” and claim that “Reddit is a place for creating community and belonging, not for attacking marginalised or vulnerable groups of people“.

The ban marks a gradual but clear policy reversal. Reddit has long been criticised for hosting hate speech and other harmful content – it famously stood by users who posted stolen nudes back in 2014 – and has been sluggish to enforce the rules dealing with these offences, which it brought in over five years ago.

r/The_Donald, by far the most active of the removed groups, was a deft purveyor of the ugly online rhetoric that circles the US president. The ban will certainly have an impact on how other Reddit users behave, explains Nicolas Suzor, an associate professor at Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane. Both online and off, it sets new, stricter limits on acceptable online speech.

The franchise is over the top, crazy and surreal but it also has a core set of ideals that are consistent in every game. While the anti-nuclear weapons theme is the most prominent, the series also is anti-colonialism, anti-war and often pro-socialist. 

I break down how the series impacted my own politics and helped me break free from western centric views of history and politics.

Eurogamer reporting: ""Legendary video game developer Hideo Kojima has confirmed a new project is in development, but has said nothing about it.

In a statement issued on Kojima's official Twitter accounts and Kojima Productions' LinkedIn page, the Metal Gear creator said the studio was hiring for various roles at its Tokyo office.

In 2015, Kojima Productions split from Konami, becoming an independent studio. It released its first game, Death Stranding, in 2019.

Without any information on the new game from Kojima, we're left to speculate. Everything from Death Stranding 2 to a new Silent Hill has been rumoured since work wrapped up on Death Stranding.

The GRIFT of Kenneth Copeland - How the Demon Pastor SCAMS his Followers out of Millions,2020-11-19T01:30:00Z,PT18M27S,19137,791,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Kenneth Copeland looks like a Demon. This is just a fact. But he’s actually an insanely wealthy televangelist pastor who is estimated to be worth between $300-750 million, and owns a small airport and three private jets. Copeland has a biblical justification for all this, and makes his money from his followers donations. Trouble is, many of his followers are poor and in debt, and he uses their contributions to fund his lavish lifestyle.

I breakdown his career, what he stands for, and how he’s takes advantage of people’s faith. 

-

Huffpost reporting: ""Televangelist Kenneth Copeland has long argued that preachers of his caliber need private jets to carry out their God-given mission of spreading the Gospel to the world. The Texas pastor once again vigorously defended his ministry’s private jets and his luxurious lifestyle during an interview with “Inside Edition” reporter Lisa Guerrero.

“I’m a very wealthy man,” Copeland admitted without hesitation during the interview with Guerrero.Guerrero approached Copeland as part of a broader investigation into televangelists using expensive jets, which was first broadcast in early May. A longer version of the interview with Copeland was published on May 20 and recently went viral. 

Copeland is a popular preacher of the prosperity gospel, a strand of Christianity that teaches that material wealth and health are signs of God’s favor. The pastor and his wife, Gloria Copeland, are leaders of Kenneth Copeland Ministries, which claims to have seven offices around the world. The Copelands regularly appear on television and radio broadcasts, speak at revival meetings and have published numerous books. Kenneth Copeland is also one of the original members of President Donald Trump’s evangelical advisory committee.

Copeland’s ministry owns at least three private aircraft, “Inside Edition” reported, including a $20 million Citation 10 and a Gulfstream V jet purchased from American movie director Tyler Perry. The pastor refused to say exactly how much he spent on the Gulfstream but said Perry made the plane “so cheap for me I couldn’t help but buy it.”

The pastor has used his planes to fly to a vacation home in Colorado at least 143 times, according to “Inside Edition.” He even reportedly has his own airport next to his mansion in Texas.

The Lincoln Project has gained plaudits for its funny and creative YouTube adverts created to sway the Republican base to vote for Joe Biden in the 2020 election to get rid of Trump. Despite spending $67 million dollars, Donald Trump only increased his vote amongst his traditional voter base. I break down how The Lincoln Project was just an attempt to rehabilitated the Neo-Conservative wing of the Republican Party. 
-
Business Insider Reporting: ""Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had harsh words for The Lincoln Project on Friday, accusing the group of being in ""scam territory"" over its promise to persuade ""never-Trump"" Republicans to vote for President-elect Joe Biden.

The Lincoln Project, which was started in late 2019 by high-profile former GOP operatives including Rick Wilson and Kellyanne Conway's husband George Conway, gained a reputation — and some notoriety — this year for its memes and ads bashing President Donald Trump, including billboards in New York City mocking Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.

The group's significant war chest went toward ads in a variety of states, including deep-blue ones like New York as well as battleground states like Pennsylvania and more conservative ones like South Carolina.

But following an unexpectedly strong showing from Republicans in House of Representatives races, Ocasio-Cortez — who coasted to reelection along with fellow progressive Democrats Rep. Ilhan Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib — has clashed with centrist Democrats over the future direction of the party.

Crusades became a convenient way to view the new world.

The BJP,  bolstered by the RSS, have swept Indian politics in recent years which has led to increase tensions with its Muslim population and neighbours Pakistan, Bangladesh and Kashmir. 

The RSS was inspired by the political systems of 1930's Italy and Germany, so it may come as a shock that Hindu Nationalists also love Israel. I break down why this is the case. 

-
https://theconversation.com/why-indias-hindu-nationalists-worship-israels-nation-state-model-111450: 

India’s Hindu nationalists and the Israeli right have a remarkable mutual affinity. Binyamin Netanyahu welcomed Narendra Modi to Israel in 2017 with these words: “Prime Minister Modi, we have been waiting for you for a long time, almost 70 years … We view you as a kindred spirit.”

The two premiers, both battling for re-election in spring 2019, share a warm rapport, and regularly refer to each other on Twitter as “my friend Narendra” and “my friend Bibi.”

The Modi-Bibi bonhomie rests on much more than personal chemistry, or even the Israeli military-industrial complex’s significant role in servicing Indian needs. It is rooted in the profound admiration of generations of Hindu nationalists for Zionism and its product, Israel, whose model of nation-state they seek to emulate in India.

Indian secularists often claim that the Hindu nationalists intend to turn India into a Hindu version of Pakistan. This is not wrong. Just as Pakistan founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s politics fused religion, nation and state, so does “Hindutva”, the political ideology of Hindu nationalism born in the 1920s.

https://news.sky.com/story/france-and-islam-on-collision-course-as-emmanuel-macron-says-republics-laws-must-be-supreme-12118876

Sky News Reporting: ""Emmanuel Macron is the focus of intense protests and criticism across the Muslim world. At the heart of the controversy is a clash between secular and religious values, but there may be more to it than that.

The French president's supporters say he is simply defending his country's secularism.

His angry critics say he has offended millions of Muslims and even accused him of trying to reshape Islam, thereby touching off resentment about France's colonial past.

France has a long tradition of staunch secularism. In 1905, a law entrenched the principle of laicite (secularism) in law.

Other laws protecting the right to blaspheme go back further - there was a determined effort to keep the church out of state affairs in the wake of the French Revolution.

So whereas in some countries cartoons showing the Prophet Muhammad in an unfavourable light might be banned by blasphemy laws, that is not the case in France, where it is legally permissible to denigrate a religion, if not an individual because of the religion they practise.

There is a very clear clash between those principles and the values of Islam which forbid any image of the Prophet, let alone those that mock or ridicule him.""

-
BBC reporting: ""Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has suspended predecessor Jeremy Corbyn from the party after he said the scale of its anti-Semitism problem had been ""dramatically overstated"".

The remark followed a report finding Labour responsible for ""unlawful"" harassment and discrimination during Mr Corbyn's time in charge. Labour said he was being suspended ""for a failure to retract"" his words. Mr Corbyn called the move ""political"" and promised to ""strongly contest"" it. 

Sir Keir, who became Labour leader in April, said the publication of the Equality and Human Rights Commission's (EHRC) report had brought ""a day of shame"" for the party.

The report found the party responsible for three breaches of the Equality Act:
-Political interference in anti-Semitism complaints
-Failure to provide adequate training to those handling anti-Semitism complaints
-Harassment

The investigation found evidence of 23 instances of ""inappropriate involvement"" by Mr Corbyn's office, included staff influencing decisions on suspensions or whether to investigate a claim.

Sir Keir promised to implement the report's recommendations ""as soon as possible in the New Year"" and to change Labour's culture.

Responding to the EHRC's findings, Mr Corbyn said he was ""always determined to eliminate all forms of racism"" and ""regretted it took longer to deliver... change than it should"". But he claimed his team had ""acted to speed up, not hinder the process"", and that the scale of anti-Semitism in the party had been ""dramatically overstated for political reasons"".

How Weeaboo Culture helps Sanitise Japan’s Nationalist Politics,2020-10-29T01:15:01Z,PT20M22S,21920,1203,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Weeabo culture is one that is obessed with Japanese culture, followed by many people who actually want to be Japanese. It has its problems, especially with stereotyping, but it is an example of Japan's soft power. Through Weeabos, Japan is able to project a certain image in Western countries that usually spreads more positive traits of the island nation. However, this also has seen the West have a general perception of Japan that does not match up to the reality. 

-
Vice reporting: @Japanese culture is more accessible than ever – whether that means eating sushi while listening to Babymetal, getting a tattoo in katakana you absolutely don't understand, or watching a Netflix remake of an anime with Western actors. This has naturally led to more J-culture obsessives. The internet retaliation: to call them ""weeaboos"".

Over the past ten or so years, ""weebs"" – or the ""wapanese"" – have been identified by commenters as essentially this Urban Dictionary definition: ""A non Japanese person who basically denounces their own culture and calls themselves Japanese."" People who want to be Japanese, but aren't. If you're still confused, YouTuber TVFilthyFrank posted ""The Weeaboo Song"" in 2014, which distills the essence of a weeaboo into a simple ballad: ""Konnichiwa Senpai / Please notice me / I watch Asian cartoons / I'm a weeaboo / I live in my mom's house / I'm like thirty two / I collect swords and throwing stars / Yes, I'm a weeaboo.""

So yes, it was a way to take the p1ss. However, recently, weebs have been reclaiming the term and proudly using it like a badge of who's the biggest fan of all things Japan. Last weekend, Hyper Japan – the biannual London festival that celebrates and sells food, anime, manga and loads of Sanrio stationary you definitely don't need but buy anyway – came to town yet again, so I went along, yet again, to talk to my fellow weebs about being weeaboos.""

Why Cops and Conservatives LOVE The Punisher - From Chris Kyle to Kyle Rittenhouse,2020-10-22T00:21:01Z,PT15M5S,12043,681,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"The Punisher has risen to become one of the most beloved comic books characters in recent years, thanks to in part a Netflix show starring John Bernthal. The veteran turned vigilante sets himself apart from the MCU in the way he deals out justice to the criminal underworld. An unhinged individual, it is disturbing the Conservatives and law enforcement are increasingly adopting his iconography and ethos. I break down the issue.

Guardian reporting: Sometimes it takes a bootleg T-shirt to stop a bootleg T-shirt. Foryears, the military, the police and white supremacists have displayed the skull symbol of Marvel’s comic-book outlaw the Punisher on unauthorised clothes, bumper stickers and spray-paint stencils. But, as Black Lives Matter protests around the world draw attention to institutionalised racism, Gerry Conway, the Punisher’s politically progressive co-creator and writer, is launching an unusual fundraiser: his own line of shirts designed by people of colour to take the symbol back from the right, with proceeds to go to Black Lives Matter.

“[The skull] should be a symbol for Black Lives Matter,” Conway says. “It should be a symbol for people on the outside of the justice system. I want the movement to claim this symbol for themselves.”

The Punisher begins his life as a vigilante after he loses his family to organised crime, then any chance for justice because of the corruption of the NYPD. Conway and artist Ross Andru originally envisioned the character with a small skull-and-crossbones symbol over his heart for his 1974 debut, but Marvel’s art director, John Romita, had the idea to cover the character’s entire torso with a skull symbol.

Then in 2012, Iraq veteran Chris Kyle published his memoir American Sniper, in which he distorted his war record and bragged about spray-painting the Punisher logo on his unit’s equipment during the 2004 battle of Fallujah. Kyle’s machismo and tall tales about shooting “looters” during Hurricane Katrina made him a hero to the far right. When his book was adapted for film in 2014, the Punisher skull gained increased currency among police unions and gun-loving militiamen. Marvel, who did not respond to requests for comment, told Gizmodo last week that it was “taking seriously” unlicensed use of Punisher imagery while its notoriously litigious parent company Disney has not made any legal challenges.

How New Atheism's Crusade Against Islam and The Left helped pave the way for the Alt-Right,2020-10-17T01:00:01Z,PT22M15S,14571,822,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"9/11 broke many Western intellectual's brains. It shattered Francis Fukuyama's hypothesis about the End of History while seemingly vindicating the work of Samuel Huntington. It also deeply influenced New Atheist thinkers views, with many endorsing the new Neo-Conservative policy of the US in its wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. This left a deep scepticism of Islam in general, where sweeping generalisations of a whole religion were not only tolerated, but became the mainstream way of thinking of the West's new wars in the Islamic world. 

It is of course not surprising that the New Atheist movement on social media transitioned into the anti-SJW movement, leading many atheists to ally themselves with the Right, and often Far-Right in dunking on Leftists and Feminists as well as Muslims.

The DOWNFALL of Tulsi Gabbard - From Progressive Rising Star to PragerU Propagandist,2020-10-10T00:30:01Z,PT20M56S,13503,871,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Tulsi Gabbard is seen by many in progressive circles as an anti-war champion who is unafraid to speak out against the elites control our society and foreign policy. In this video, I outline how her anti-interventionist stance has lead to a mischaracterisation of her real politics, which have always leaned conservative, making her seem more like a libertarian. I also chart her career from her early days in Hawaii, resigning her position at the DNC, to becoming a puppet of PragerU to push conspiracy theories put out by Project Veritas. 
-
Refinery29: ""Despite finally fading into the shadows after a contentious presidential primary race, it seems former Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard has foisted herself back in the spotlight — and she comes bearing conspiracy theories and aligning herself with right-wingers. Surprise!

A new Twitterstorm headed Gabbard's way after the Hawaii Representative reinforced backing Bill H.R. 8285, better known as the Election Fraud Prevention Act (EFPA). The bill, which she first introduced earlier this month, aims to discourage ballot harvesting — but there are a few caveats to Gabbard's support. Ahead of the November election, the representative expressed serious concern over states that are legally allowed to practice ballot harvesting — a practice that allows third parties to collect and deliver people’s ballots in some parts of America. The EFPA would ensure that ballots are handled by election officials and mail carriers, and in certain cases, family members, household members, or caregivers. 

To add fuel to the fire, the newly released videos that Gabbard refers to as capturing alleged ballot harvesting are actually completely devoid of any real evidence. The video that Project Veritas released purports to show political operatives in Minneapolis, Minnesota illegally carrying out the practice, as accused by controversial community figure Omar Jamal. Jamal accuses Ilhan Omar of being behind it all, despite total lack of evidence, and the alleged ballots not even being tied to her race. Beyond the lack of evidence, it's completely unclear when the videos were taken, and a preliminary investigation by The Daily Dot also disproves the Jamal's credibility as an expert.

He broke away from TYT after falling out with his boss Cenk Uyger as he did not support Israel as much as Rubin would like, made apparent by the infamous debate he had with Sam Harris. 

Dave Rubin has steadily marched to the Right-Wing of the political spectrum, recently announcing he is both a Conservative and a future Trump voter. While his show used to have a host of people across the political spectrum, it now only features far-right conservative Fox News talking heads like Sean Hannity, Donald Trump Jr, Newt Gingrich, Ted Cruz and Jeanne Pirro. Rubin also regularly features on Fox News, a network he has mocked in the past. 

I discuss the 7-year transition in this video and explain why he sold out.

Eddie Redmayne SELLS OUT Trans Community and DEFENDS JK Rowling,2020-09-30T23:40:00Z,PT15M52S,7284,384,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"The Harry Potter cast is divided over JK Rowling's crusade against the Trans community. The original cast of Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and Daniel Radcliffe (among others) have come out against the author of the Harry Potter books, while the actor of Hagrid has taken her side. 

Recently, Fantastic Beasts star has come out to condemn abuse on 'both sides'. Redmayne has in the past been nominated for playing a trans character. I break down his comments and the overall situation. 

- 
Guardian reporting: Fantastic Beasts star Eddie Redmayne has said he is alarmed by the “vitriol” aimed at Harry Potter author JK Rowling after her comments on trans rights, adding the reaction on social media was “absolutely disgusting”.

Redmayne was speaking to the Daily Mail during the shoot of the third Fantastic Beasts film, which is produced and co-written by Rowling. He said he had sent her a private note.

Redmayne also defended his “trans friends and colleagues” who are “facing discrimination on a daily basis”, adding: “Similarly, there continues to be a hideous torrent of abuse towards trans people online and out in the world that is devastating.”

In June, Redmayne publicly disagreed with Rowling’s lengthy statement on trans rights. He said: “As someone who has worked with both JK Rowling and members of the trans community, I wanted to make it absolutely clear where I stand. I disagree with Jo’s comments. Trans women are women, trans men are men and nonbinary identities are valid.”

Harry Potter stars Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson also stated their disagreement.

Bleacher Report: Colby Covington proved he might not need American Top Team to succeed after all. The longstanding rivalry between Covington (16-2, 3 KOs) and Tyron Woodley (19-6, 7 KOs) saw the two welterweight stars, and former teammates, finally meet in the Octagon for UFC Fight Night 178. It did not go well for Woodley. Covington, a heavy favorite, controlled the fight from the opening bell and earned a technical knockout in the fifth round 

Now he wants another shot at Kamaru Usman after getting TKO'd in 2019. He may have earned the chance on Saturday.

Gamerant reporting: While Twitch's latest string of bans has focused on removing creators facing sexual abuse allegations from its platform, it also appears to be taking a firmer stance on violent and hateful speech. Twitch recently made headlines for indefinitely suspending ex-YouTuber Leafy, and now it's taken action against one of its own controversial figures. According to the streamer Steven ""Destiny"" Bonnell, Twitch has revoked his partnership for ""encouragement of violence"" in a recent stream.

One recent tweet enclosed a screenshot from Destiny, who claims that Twitch's legal department was responsible for his removal. Following high-profile bans, like that of Dr. Disrespect, social media users will frequently claim that the Twitch legal department is overriding the company's partnership and ban moderators. Although Destiny claims that Twitch did not specify which statement justified its latest decision, Reddit users on the LivestreamFail subreddit quickly found a clip that might explain Twitch's recent move.

In the Twitch clip, Destiny condemns the ongoing protests and riots, and claimed that they ""need to... stop,"" even if it required violence. Specifically, Destiny claimed that if white nationalists started ""mowing down"" protesters in order to stop them, he personally would approve of their actions.

Largely, the Reddit users who saw this clip agreed that Destiny's statement warranted the removal of his Twitch partnership. One user even agreed that Destiny's statements, outside of turning prospective viewers and clients away from Twitch or parent company Amazon, could potentially cause legal trouble for the streaming titan. While some people wondered why Twitch did not completely ban Destiny, some believe that his statements violated his partnership contract, but not Twitch's general Terms of Service. This also lines up with Destiny's off-site history, considering his permanent ban from Twitter for making death threats.

This has not been affected by lockdown, but Mr Beast has still received between $350,000-1,000,000 in Government relief as part of the CARES Act. I break it down. 

-

Insider reporting: ""MrBeast YouTube LLC and Jeffree Star Cosmetics both received loans intended to provide relief to small businesses hurt by the coronavirus pandemic, Mashable reported on Wednesday.

ProPublica's database of companies approved for over $150,000 in Paycheck Protection Program loans and disclosed by the Small Business Administration showed that MrBeast YouTube LLC and Jeffree Star Cosmetics each received a loan of $350,000 to $1 million. The esports company FaZe Clan also received a loan worth $1 million to $2 million.

PPP loans, part of the federal CARES Act, are intended to help small businesses weather the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and keep workers on payrolls. The Small Business Administration said the loans would be fully forgiven if funds were put toward payroll costs, mortgage interest, rent, and utilities.

MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, is a YouTuber with about 42.8 million subscribers on his main channel. He's best known for his charity giveaways and extravagant challenges. The Verge reported in 2018 that much of MrBeast's money came from brand deals.

A representative for MrBeast YouTube LLC confirmed to Mashable that the company had received a loan, saying that it employed over 40 employees (the representative told Mashable that the ProPublica database showing that it reported only seven was a clerical error) and that many of its brand partnerships had fallen through during the pandemic.

Incorporating a real-life historical and political figure — one whose tenure still has controversial effects on modern-day politics, including the imminent 2020 election — is definitely a move. It’s an even weirder one when you consider what the trailer has Reagan doing: ordering you, the player, and your fellow clandestine operatives to essentially break the law and commit potential war crimes in order to save the “free world.”

The trailer features a discussion of codename “Perseus,” a supposed KGB spy (based on real-life Cold War events) that new character Russell Adler says “will shift the balance of the Cold War” if they don’t do something to stop the plot. But when discussion of the legality of the mission arises, that’s when we get into murky territory. “Every mission we go on is illegal,” protests fan-favorite Black Ops character Frank Woods, who says a lot of innocent people will perish if they don’t stop Perseus.

Thankfully, this is when the president shows up to give the final word. “We’re talking about preventing an attack on the free men and women of the world. Give Mr. Adler whatever he wants,” says Reagan upon entering the room and commenting that it was him, in fact, that approved the Black Ops crew’s prior missions. “Gentleman, you’ve been given a great task: protecting our very way of life from a great evil. There is no higher duty, there is no higher honor, and while few people will know of your struggles, rest assured the entire free world will benefit. I know you won’t fail us.”

It’s a good thing Reagan is here to reassure us, the players, that what we’re doing is in fact Good, or else Call of Duty fans everywhere might get the wrong impression about America’s role in geopolitical conflicts around the globe. Can’t have that happening!

Ubisoft releases new Tom Clancy Game trailer showing Antifa and BLM inspired group as the Villains,2020-09-01T00:20:00Z,PT14M6S,3851,288,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Ubisoft donated 100,000 dollars to BLM and the NAACP in the wake of the recent months of protest against systemic racism and police brutality. It's corporate commitment to anti-racism seems to not have lasted as they released a new cutscene/trailer for their latest mobile game Tom Clancy's Elite Squad which shows a Leftist-Antifa-BLM inspired group as the villans.

Jason Schrier at Bloomberg reporting: ""Video game publisher Ubisoft Entertainment SA will remove a controversial scene from its latest mobile game that appeared to link Black Lives Matter imagery to a terrorist group, according to an internal message reviewed by Bloomberg News.

Last week, Ubisoft released Tom Clancy’s Elite Squad, a game for iOS and Android in which the player builds a team of fighters to take on Umbra, a terrorist organization. In the game’s introductory video, Umbra is portrayed as a “faceless organization that wants to build a new world order.” Umbra, which uses a raised black fist as its logo, is described as a group that attempts to stoke riots and undermine world leaders through social media.

The video became the subject of intense social media criticism over the weekend, coming against the backdrop of violent protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, following the police shooting of Jacob Blake on Aug. 23. This year has been an inflection point for the Black Lives Matter movement and has seen widespread calls for racial justice after a policeman killed George Floyd in late May. In June, Ubisoft said it would donate $100,000 to the NAACP and Black Lives Matter.

On Saturday, Ubisoft apologized for the Tom Clancy’s Elite Squad video and said it would remove the “’raised fist’ imagery” from the game. On Sunday, in a thread on Ubisoft’s internal message board, Mana, employees said they were furious that this had happened. “Ubisoft needs to do better,” wrote one employee in a lengthy message reviewed by Bloomberg.

Charlie Guillemot, the game’s creative director and general manager of Ubisoft’s Owlient studio, responded with an apology and pledged to remove the “entire introductory sequence” from the game. “In the future, we will more rigorously review content produced and about to be released in order to help us avoid similar mistakes,” he wrote in an internal message reviewed by Bloomberg.

The introductory sequence was produced in 2018, according to the post on Mana by Guillemot. But some users on Twitter said the game’s fascist undertones should have raised red flags. Ubisoft has recently come under widespread scrutiny for its culture. Earlier this year, the French publisher ousted several executives and other employees who were accused of sexual misconduct. A Businessweek investigation found that many of the complaints had been filed years earlier and that Ubisoft had ignored or mishandled them. Chief Executive Officer Yves Guillemot has promised extensive changes.

Ubisoft is run by five brothers who founded the company in 1986. Charlie Guillemot, the CEO’s son, earned a master’s degree in computer science in 2014, according to his LinkedIn profile. Months later he became the general manager of the Owlient studio in Paris, where Tom Clancy’s Elite Squad was developed.""

David Dobrik and The Cult of Elon Musk: How Influencers help Whitewash Tesla's abuse of its Workers,2020-08-28T00:23:00Z,PT17M39S,11948,731,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"David Dobrik is a massive YouTuber who also loves his Tesla cars. So much so, he features them in many of his video.

This video discusses how influencers and social media fan communities around the Tesla brands help sanitise the company’s treatment of its workers.


——————————————————————————————

The flying Tesla challenge as described by Dexerto: ‘’Elon Musk responds to David Dobrik's epic 'flying' Tesla stunt

SpaceX and Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, was left in disbelief after YouTube star David Dobrik pulled a stunt with his Model X that sent it flying over a speed bump in a Los Angeles suburb.

David Dobrik’s popularity on YouTube and social media has snowballed of-late. Mostly known for his generosity and comedic antics, millions tune-in to his vlogs in a bid to keep-up with his crazy lifestyle. 

Dobrik often rolls around in his Model X as the designated driver for the Vlog Squad, but in his January 28 upload, he put Elon Musk’s flagship car to the test.

The flying Tesla challenge?

After watching Instagram stars, josh_ofthe_jungle and nickpasquale1919, fly over a speed bump on their motorbikes, the 23-year-old was urged not to let them mimic their efforts in David’s Tesla by Suzy. 

Elon's reaction says it all...
David’s escapade caught the attention of Elon Musk on Twitter, who simply responded with an exclamation mark, to signal his utter surprise. 

The 23-year-old YouTube sensation responded with: “Does this mean my warranty is cancelled?” in a witty clap, sent back to the shocked Tesla CEO. 

Dobrik casually went on to gift $10,000 to one lucky college student, alongside $25,000 to his Suzy’s Mom for her birthday.

Pornhub is the biggest company in the porn industry. It portrays itself as a socially progressive company and has numerous schemes to help the environment and help people during the global lockdowns.

However, Pornhub is a company built on exploitation and this video will examine how it’s often good deeds and ‘woke’ stances seem like an act.

Anti-Socialist Call of Duty trailer SPREADS Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory (ft Yuri Bezmenov),2020-08-21T00:36:00Z,PT18M30S,18021,1089,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War recently got a teaser trailer. The short trailer focused on Soviet defector Yuri Bezmenov, who talked at length about all the ways the Communists were supposedly infiltrating and taking over America.

It is largely nonsense, conspiracy filled with bits of racism thrown in as well as parroting both Cultural Marxist and Cultural Bolshevik conspiracy theories. Focusing a games narrative around this man is clearly problematic. 

IGN reports: “Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War has officially been announced, and with a full reveal planned for August 26, Activision released the first official art that shows the conflict between the United States and USSR. In a brief video teaser on the official Call of Duty Twitter page, Activision revealed the key art for Treyarch and Raven's new military shooter. The image shows brief snippets of propaganda posters that eventually tear away to show a split figure, one side a Soviet soldier, the other American.

Black Ops: Cold War appears to be highlighting this pivotal 20th-century conflict while drawing some parallels to the current political climate. The first teaser showed KGB defector Yuri Bezmenov give a speech about undermining the United States narrated over news footage from the 1960s. (https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-cover) 

A little bit about Yuri Bezmenov: “Yuri Alexandrovich Bezmenov, known by alias Tomas David Schuman, was a Soviet journalist for RIA Novosti and a former PGU KGB informant who defected to Canada.

After being assigned to a station in India, Bezmenov eventually grew to love the people and the culture of India. At the same time, he began to resent the KGB-sanctioned repression of intellectuals who dissented from Moscow's policies. He decided to defect to the West. Bezmenov is best remembered for his anticommunist lectures and books from the 1980s.

Since his death Yuri Bezmenov's ""Soviet subversion model"" has been studied and interpreted by faculty and staff at the Joint Special Operations University. His model of subversion, has been used by the JSOU to analyze historical events since his death, including the decade-long Russian campaign that preceded the 2008 Russo-Georgian War. His work has also been cited by senior director of UPenn's Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, and former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Dr. Michael Carpenter. His lectures have also been used by Yale senior lecturer Asha Rangappa, to illustrate the concept of active measures in Russia's historical disinformation campaigns in the United States.

On August 19, 2020, Bezmenov's 1984 interview discussing active measures was used in the worldwide reveal of Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War.”

Why the Warhammer 40k community has a Nazi Problem (Arch/Games Workshop),2020-08-19T00:00:03Z,PT15M33S,47513,1940,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Warhammer 40k is the popular table top world taking place far in the future. The Imperium of Man is largely recognised as a satire of totalitarian fascist system, but it seems some of the fan base have taken this more literally. 

Vice reported this week that: ""In recent years, the game – whose players often congregate online – has attracted a small but vocal alt-right minority. In 2015, the “God Emperor Trump” meme began circulating around 4Chan’s /pol/ board, depicting Trump’s face superimposed on an image of a fictional theocratic ruler from the game. Since then, closed 40k Facebook groups have become a repository of racism and far-right content, filled with Warhammer-themed memes mocking everything from specific ethnic minorities to gender equality.""

But this video focuses more on Games Workshop and Arch, a popular Warhammer YouTuber, known as “Arch Warhammer” until a recent trademark dispute with Games Workshop prompted a name change. He launched an email campaign in July, urging his 200,000 plus subscribers to email Games Workshop and tell them to “keep politics out”. This was in response to a letter by No More Damsels’ co-founder, Sarah Pipkin, helped to write an open letter addressed to Games Workshop, calling out bigotry in Warhammer.

It is also felt the game simplifies its fascist themes to appeal to children, making the Imperium an attractive faction to buy miniatures for.

A Detailed Breakdown of Joe Biden's DISGUSTINGLY RACIST Political Record - (1972 - 2020),2020-03-04T23:30:02Z,PT12M17S,3849,303,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Joe Biden has always been an awful politician from the beginning of his career to now. The only reason he’s even relevant is because the political decisions were taken out of his hands when he was made Vice President. Hitching himself to one of the most popular Presidents of all time was a smart move but as we now examine his record we may even question why the hell Obama made someone like him his running mate. This video will be a definitive takedown of Joe Biden and his awful political record. Notice how I have used the word takedown over breakdown. I am not looking to point out any good Biden has done – I am simply highlighting all the policies he’s overseen and supported that should disqualifying from being an acceptable consideration for President.

Someone with a record this awful on race in America has no business being a candidate in this cycles Democratic primary. No person who championed and celebrated his racist policies should be considered by any Democrat as a potential future president. His contemporary Bernie Sanders proves that Biden’s tender years are absolutely no excuse for any of his past actions. The crime bill is the culmination of Biden racist past, something that has been responsible for untold destruction of millions of lives in America.

In one mission you fight on the 'Highway of Death' in the fictional country of Urkistan. The Russian army is blamed for carrying out the initial bombing. However many in Russia feel this is a Western game blaming them for the US bombing of the real Highway of Death between Kuwait and Iraq during the first Gulf War in 1991. I break it down. 

-

Call of Duty is the biggest video game franchise of all time, constantly topping the sales chart every year since 2007. However as a game made by Westerners, for Westerners, it often displays history and politics in a way that unfairly makes the US look good or absolves it of crimes they committed in various conflicts. I break this down through the lens of Orientalism targeting Modern Warfare and Black Ops 1 and Black Ops 2.

Peterson adapts this and believes the Marxist conspiracy is aimed at winning the Cold War through indoctrinating the next generation in Marxist theory. However Peterson's worldview is dangerous as it can easily incorporate

Capitalism globally has enriched many Western countries and the expense of less developed countries. On a more national scale Capitalism enriches a small elite on the backs of the populace’s labour. 

Ethiopia sees both happen. It’s Elite offers up its population to giant Western corporations for them to be exploited. In turn this helps keep the global capitalist system status quo in check while also keeping the national one the same.

So in Hitler's own words he and the Nazi Party were in no way Marxists/Socialists.

It is also more sinister than it seems. It perpetrates cultural racism, the idea that Judeo-Christian Values are superior to all others and justify painting others as backwards.

The only reason he’s even relevant is because the political decisions were taken out of his hands when he was made Vice President. Hitching himself to one of the most popular Presidents of all time was a smart move but as we now examine his record we may even question why the hell Obama made someone like him his running mate. This video will be a definitive takedown of Joe Biden and his awful political record. Notice how I have used the word takedown over breakdown. I am not looking to point out any good Biden has done – I am simply highlighting all the policies he’s overseen and supported that should disqualifying from being an acceptable consideration for President.

Someone with a record this awful on race in America has no business being a candidate in this cycles Democratic primary. No person who championed and celebrated his racist policies should be considered by any Democrat as a potential future president. His contemporary Bernie Sanders proves that Biden’s tender years are absolutely no excuse for any of his past actions. The crime bill is the culmination of Biden racist past, something that has been responsible for untold destruction of millions of lives in America.

He also has many common sense domestic policies outlined on his website. He chief concern is what will happen to America when automation takes over many low skilled jobs.

However there are some concerns. Yang doesn't have any political track record on things like prison reform, tackling climate change or rallying against generic US foreign policy. Lately he has also been actively courting the right wing and pushing some alt-right style talking points which is very concerning.

What AOC represents is a shift in traditional politics, one where younger people will no longer accept Democrats trying to make incremental change to appease the massive.

They have been on the fringes of the public eye for most of their political careers but have gained prominence in the last 5 years.

Bernie and Corbyn share a lot of similarities with the most striking being that they were consistent activists fro social justice. Corbyn personally protests the UK Governments support for Apartheid South Africa (where he was arrested), consistently protested against Britain arming dictators around the world and giving a great speech at the biggest anti-war march in British history in London against the Iraq war in 2003. He also has consistently been an advocate for gay rights and helped greatly with solving Irish issues - such as pushing to overturn the convictions of the Guildford 4 and Birmingham 6 and meeting with leaders of Sinn Fein to solve the Northern Irish troubles of the 1970’s-1990’s.

Bernie was the leader of UChicago CORE group and protested for equal housing for black students. He was also arrested for protesting housing discrimination in general. He was in attendance at MLK ‘I have a dream’ speech in Washington and King is a personal idol of Bernie.

This video analyses their activist days and how this informs our perception of them many years leaders. Corbyn and Bernie seem genuine and honest because they have walked the walk as young men before talking the talk as leaders in their later years.

A British take on why Bernie Sanders is the ONLY Choice for America in 2020,2019-03-07T01:30:00Z,PT13M17S,25828,2268,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Although British politics is absolutely fucked at the moment, there are parts of the British system that align very closely with its Western neighbours. Many socialist policies were implemented by the Atlee government after the Second World War including the NHS. It’s fair to say in many departments including welfare and social safety nets the US is severely lacking.

Bernie Sanders is often considered a ‘radical’ but in the context of Western Europe and Scandinavia in particular, most of Sanders ideas have been adopted already. 

Personally I have always loved American history and politics, and it made up a massive amount of my undergrad and postgrad studies. With this in mind and my upbringing in the UK I give my opinion on why I think Bernie is the only choice. A consistent politician who walked the walk in Civil and Gay Rights and has been a constant and consistent voice on climate change, anti-interventionism and healthcare I feel it’s time the US elected someone like Bernie to catch up with the rest of the world in many areas.

I present the argument that these things cannot be exclusive. If you are fiscally conservative and support tax cuts for the wealthy and the general empowerment of the rich while slashing money for social programs and healthcare then you are not socially liberal. Supporting equal rights for all races and genders is not compatible with taking away funding for things that help those groups while contributing to a system that has historically oppressed them.

America would have NEVER dropped Nukes on Nazi Germany,2019-03-01T01:30:01Z,PT11M59S,1642,70,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"The decisions to drop two nuclear bombs on Japan during World War II was pretty uncontroversial at the time. The war in Europe had been over for over two months before the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. People were happy with a quick end to the war which came with the Japanese surrender following the bombings.

Undoubtedly a mainland invasion of Japan would have cost more lives (Allied and Japanese) than those lost in the nuclear blast. However there are other factors to keep in mind when thinking about why the US carried out the bombings. An obvious one being that they didn’t want the Soviet Union to be a part of the war against Japan for long as it would give them a chance to secure more territory for the Communists, including Japan.

Less obvious is the racism that lead to Japan being the only country in history to be hit with nukes. American attitudes toward Asians, socially and legislatively, was incredibly racist. There had been numerous laws against Asians (with many still being upheld) and they were generally regarded as inferior. The propaganda campaign against the Japanese emphasised racist caricatures and stereotypes. The Japanese-Americans were also the only group related to the Axis to face repercussion in America - with 120,000 of them being locked up in internment camps, while the German and Italy communities were relatively left alone.

It is clear bombing a nation that was made up of a race the Americans viewed as alien and inferior was part of the motivation for the bombing. This video also argues that America would have never used the same type of weapon on Germany - a white country where many Americans originated from and had a shared history.

Most members of this community are descendants of the slaves brought over from Africa and this legacy still affects their standing today. While many may feel the US racism leading up to and after the war is indicative of wider racial prejudices in the Western world, the story I am about to go into detail on shows this isn’t the case. This story focuses around a standoff between White and Black American troops stationed in Lancashire, England as they no doubt prepared for the invasion of mainland Europe.

While to it’s credit many films dealing with minority and LGBT characters have been nominated, the quality of the films in the Best Picture category is underwhelming.

Truly great films like First Man have been completely snubbed and the 2019 Oscars make precious omissions hurt even more. Whether it was Logan, The Dark Knight or Blade Runner 2049. 2019 proves you don’t have to be a traditional Oscar bait film to get nominated and apparently you also don’t need to even be a more than average film anymore.

Chris Pratt is the NEW Tom Cruise,2019-02-16T00:30:00Z,PT14M29S,1738,53,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Chris Pratt has recently come under fire from LGBT Actress Ellen Page for being a part of an anti-LGBT Church with a Pastor who has expressed strong anti-gay views. Pratt became extremely defensive and said the Church wasn’t discriminatory because it helped Chris through his divorces. The Hillsong Church has also endorsed gay conversion therapy. 

This video also looks into Chris’s really weird relationship with hunting in which he believes killing defenceless animals brings him closer to God, as well as describing how much him and his kids love and get to know specific farm animals before he personally kills them.

A Nazi Campaign without the Nazis | BFV: The Last Tiger Review,2018-12-08T01:15:01Z,PT19M27S,14422,278,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Summary: With a DICE it’s one step forward and two steps back. This is the first major WW2 shooter to have a German campaign and does have some powerful moments and some insight into the chaos of the last days of the war from a German perspective. It is also pretty unsettling fighting and killing American soldiers.

One thing that was glaring was the almost complete omission of Nazis and Nazism. Still no Nazi iconography and no Nazi salutes - feels very strange when we are dealing with a war story that is at a time when the Nazis were ordering everyone to fight and killing those who disobeyed - included teenagers.

I get the multiplayer but considering the themes and dialogue in this war story it’s very weird Nazism isn’t a part of it. Sure that young guy in your squad is the typical brainwashed Nazi but still. I feel someone who doesn’t know much about the war could get quite a warped view on the Germans - could almost see them as honourable-fighting to the death for their country-I think taking it out kinda undercuts a lot of the messaging in the war story.

In the climate in the United States it is completely immoral to disrespect the troops or question the US foreign policy.

Maintaining the US's imperial grip on the world? Killing the poorest people on the planet in the name of freedom? Slaughtering those who want to control their own destiny in their country?

Jordan Peterson - The Incel Intellectual | Witches and Enforced Monogamy,2018-05-19T22:15:56Z,PT19M27S,20626,844,N/A,The Kavernacle,UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw,"Jordan Peterson recently gave a New York Times access to him, in which the reporter followed him to events and spoke with him at his home. The article reads like a satirical piece but it is completely tru. In the article Peterson argues for forced monogamy for women while also arguing the Incel terrorist attack is partly the fault of a society that doesn't love male supremacists who view women as objects. He also went on a weird rant about dragons and witches existing.

I break down the article and give my view on what makes 'intellectuals' like Peterson so popular. In short I believe they tell prejudice people it is okay to feel how they do and it is societies fault for forcing them to accept change, despite this change often being for the benefit of equality.
