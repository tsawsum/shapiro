This video discusses the real reasons why NFL running backs have become ""devalued"" and seeks to expose how this process of devaluation is not only a deliberate alteration of the nature of the game for ""good business"" but it also fits into a historical tradition of premiere black athletes being marginalized in sports they helped to build.

Join me in a journey into hip hop lore to discuss one of hip hop's forgotten legends lost in time.  He's a rapper that barely anyone remembers but for a moment in the mid 90s he was considered to be one of the rappers that would lead hip hop into the next generation.  Why was he so hyped and why does nobody remember him, and how is his legacy so important in the first place?

For generations black men have either enthusiastically celebrated or quietly disregarded the rampant and unchecked objectification of our bodies by... well pretty much everyone.  In this video F.D tries to investigate how this came to be, how some black men have tried to address it in different ways, and the dark realities that we usually look past when it comes to black men and s*x.

In this video F.D continues examining the modern online manosphere by looking at several figures that shape what the manosphere is and what it is capable of. In this video F.D argues that the problem in the manosphere isn't just it's misogyny, but how it presents masculinity as a whole, and this aspect makes it more damaging to everyone else.

This exploration caused him rethink the place that edgelords have in modern manifestations of how men see the world and how the world sees men, which forced him to finally begin thinking on the Manosphere and trying to break down exactly what it is and why it exists.

Nicki Minaj exists in an interesting place in hip hop history.  For a moment in hip hop she seemed like a once in a lifetime occurrence, a female MC who could rhyme, captivate a massive fanbase, make hits, and sell millions of records as good as any man in the industry... but then her success somehow backfired.  Now in the wake of her own success, all the things that made Nicki standout seem to be being copied by a generation of female artists built in her image. Worse yet, her name is brought up more for controversy than anything else these last few years.  But that doesn't mean her legacy and story of how she changed hip hop isn't worth telling.

In this episode of the Black Media Breakdown F.D tries to tell the complicated story of Nicki Minaj and her impact on hip hop all while telling the truth as he sees it... and hopefully avoiding the wrath of the Barbz.

In this video we use at Will Smith's recent public meltdown as a jumping off point to look at some challenges of black boyhood and how the constant barrage of trauma affects even the most successful and outwardly charming and charismatic black men.  To do this we will be looking at Belair the reimagining of Will Smith's star making show ""The Fresh Prince of Belair"" as well as shows like Atlanta and numerous other figures and stories pertinent to the issue.

After a nostalgic trip down memory lane in the last video, F.D takes Obama's legacy to task in this one. In the process, he looks at the many glaring issues with Obama's legacy as a president that are often glossed over due to his sterling reputation and historical significance. In the process, F.D takes to task the lessons often taken from Obama and the impact he's had on the image of black success and whether that image is a good or bad thing.

Barack Obama is a beloved and historical figure both in American history, but also in black culture. His sudden ascendency to the top of American politics took the world by storm and shocked a nation into rethinking race politics and what was possible and feasible for black people. However, as with all political figures, Obama has a complicated legacy that in many ways betrays his image as a pristine figure of progressive ideals and black excellence.

In this first part of a 2 part series, F.D explores Obama's rise to power and the elements that endeared him to the country, but also examines the subtext of why people fell in love with Obama as a political figure and how that love affair may have been more one sided than we want to admit.",,27,1903,0

""Black Love"" as a concept has been around for decades as an aesthetic that black people aspire to when seeking out romantic partnerships. However, when you sit back and examine the concept of how we imagine black love, you realize the ""black"" part of it doesn't mean a whole lot. In fact, a lot of how we look at and define black love seems to be directly connected to an image of love that is completely pulled from frameworks that were never meant for black people.

In this video F.D examines the dangers and problems of accepting this framework uncritically and talks to various black couples about their experiences with love as well as shows like HBO's Love Live and Insecure as well and numerous pop culture happenings with intended goal of killing our concept of black love goals.

Drake is one of the biggest and most successful musicians of all time and within the last decade has made an indelible mark on hip hop as it's most recognizable, marketable, bankable, and influential figure… and F.D isn't too happy with that.

The black athlete is an iconic image of masculinity in America, and in many communities, black or otherwise, the men who find success at the highest levels of professional athletics are idolized.  However, the space that these athletes inhabit is much more complex and perilous than the celebrity image of pro sports lets on.   In fact, from the time that many of these men were children, they have had to build up a mindset to harden them against the inconceivable challenges that they need to go through to make it to the highest levels.

In this video, F.D examines what that process looks like and dives into some of the uglier parts of prep, collegiate, and pro sports to unearth what is happening off the court and away from the field for black male athletes.

After a few months of “success” on the platform, I sat to contemplate my journey from unknown content creator scraping for views to hot new video essayist and legit “left tuber”.  This contemplation led to numerous questions and ponderings, and as I dived into those questions I started to get frustrated the answers that I arrived at.  I got tired of people asking me “where have you been this whole time” when I knew I had been just quietly treading water, wondering why my videos weren’t being seen, and wondering why I barely saw any creators in the mold of what I wanted to do.

To explore these emotions, I talked to a variety of creators and experts on the nature of YouTube as a media platform the algorithmic systems that govern it, and the greater culture around it.  I  delved into my own concerns and observations about the landscape of YouTube, especially “left tube”.

This video is my thesis on what challenges I and other black creators face.

However, it seems like it has fallen into the status of a movie that is looked at as out of touch with modern sensibilities.  This is a fair criticism, but I think it's a bit too simple.  So in this episode I breakdown what made this movie good then and why it's still relevant now.

Also just a heads up... this almost didn't make it to yall on time cause the bots were on my behind.  If you want to see the intended version of this video please look out for it on nebula very soon.  Check the Connecting the Manosphere video for a link to sign up.

Dave Chappelle's most recent special ""The Closer"" has understandably left a lot of his long-time fans divided.  Many are dismayed at the relentlessly increasing use of jokes about trans people, others (most it seems) don't see the big deal and applaud Chappelle for ""standing up"" against cancel culture.  

Regardless of where you stand, I feel like there's A LOT that almost everyone discussing this conflict is missing, and that many of the voices most affected by this conversation haven't had a chance to speak.

In this video, F.D tries to cut through the various layers of what's at stake here as he takes yet another of his heroes to task, but also tries to refine some of the parts of Chappelle's good points that are being missed in the backlash.

All of this on this episode of the Black Media Breakdown...

Within that time, Kanye created a legacy and fanbase unlike the music world had ever seen.  In this final part of my analysis of his work, I look at the second half of Kanye's career aka ""New Kanye"" where he reinvents not just himself but also the genre of hip hop as a whole and what it means to be a rap artist... for better and for worse.  I also examine where this journey has left his fanbase and what to think about going forward as this story isn't quite over.

Re-upload after being taken down a 3rd time...

(Somehow I didn't put a content warning in the beginning of the video. I apologize for that.)


Mike Tyson started a new chapter of his profound career as a boxer and media icon as he battled his way to a “draw” with fellow boxing legend Mr. “Yall Must Have Forgot” himself Roy Jones Jr.  This return to the ring feels like the completion of a story arc worthy of 10 seasons of a Netflix drama.  Tyson has gone from neglected and abused street urchin to world-famous prizefighter, to rock bottom and now back to relevance.  But with his newfound relevance, Tyson seems to have tamed the heinous demons that plagued him and with that experience, he has shifted from sports icon to lifestyle and self-help icon.

However, how did he get here? Moreover, what does it say about us and the world that he could make this journey considering the many ugly moments he’s had on his journey.  Is Tyson just another example of poorly behaved men never facing justice, or is he a cautionary tale that provides insight on how to recover from your demons and better yourself?

I’d have to say both.  

In this episode of the Black Media Breakdown Fiq signifies on the life and career of Mike Tyson.  He looks at everything that made him the baddest man on the planet, as well as all the ways in which we learn more about ourselves and the world through his story.  So take a seat, this is a long one but it’s worth it.

To be honest, they aren't learning cause they're not trying and that is what it is.  However... what about you?  

Are you interested in learning more about allyship with marginalized groups?  Do you have a sinking feeling in your gut around how to do more to help those who are being marginalized by social injustice?  Well, today is your lucky day.  In this video, I'm going to give some broad strokes on how and why Hollywood is so bad at showing what it means to be an ally (which is why most of us are also bad at it) and I'm also going to talk to some experts in the field who teach people what good allyship looks like and why it's so hard for a lot of people to understand.

If you're interested in learning more about allyship please sign up for Uplifting Impact's ""How to be an Ally"" Virtual Summit happening October 4th through the 6th.

Several videos from other creators and plenty of tik toks have been speaking on this idea of divesting from labor.

While this makes plenty of sense overall, I can't help but think that it seems to be a bit short-sighted or at least, not very inclusive, especially when you start to consider gender and race in the equation.

In response, I wanted to think about the way work has...worked for black men throughout history.  How and why does work define us?  How would divestment from work...work for black men?  Now that I think about it, isn't this something we've been doing for a while now?

"Bo Burnham's Inside and ""White Liberal Performative Art""",2021-08-13T19:00:13Z,PT36M24S,2494243,188819,N/A,F.D Signifier,UCgi2u-lGY-2i2ubLsUr6FbQ,"Bo Burnham's Inside currently streaming on Netflix is one of the best things I've seen all year.  It perfectly captures so much of the emotions I think all of us felt in the last 18 months or so... emotions that we probably should keep close since things are going in reverse.

However, some parts of Bo Burnham's experimental special were... a bit othering.  I realized that as a whole the special wasn't for me.  It was a deeply personal piece that spoke explicitly to Bo's experiences and worldview, and as a ""straight white male"", there's definitely some elements of his worldview that aren't going to look the same from my standpoint.

This got me thinking about other works of art with similar themes.  I think there's tons of art made by white creators that speak explicitly to a white worldview in a way that isn't explained by just being ""for general audiences"".  I named it ""White Liberal Performative Art"" and I'm super proud of myself for that lol.  

In this video I give a little background on what brought me to this idea and how Bo Burnham's Inside works as a proof of concept for it.

Black Men and Love,2021-07-30T20:00:12Z,PT1H2M15S,265105,18193,N/A,F.D Signifier,UCgi2u-lGY-2i2ubLsUr6FbQ,"The discourse for discussing black men and relationships is... spotty to say the least.  Between the rise of certain relationship commentators, the ""Divestment"" movement, and everything in between, there's a lot of people saying a lot of stuff at the extremes of this topic.

While there are important nuggets of information and discussions going on, I can't help but feel like there's a few important pieces of the puzzle that haven't been talked about yet.  With that in mind, I figured I'd try to add my two cents, talk about a few of my favorite movies (Love Jones and Love and Basketball) that I haven't seen people talk about in a while, and bring up a few more examples of how black men experience and receive love.

To add to the pot, I also brought in a few friends from various communities, ages, and experiences to speak on what they see and feel as well. So we cover a bit of everything, being vulnerable, lacking emotional connection, playing a man's role, and the closest thing a man has to lacking pretty privilege... being broke!

All that and more on this episode of the Black Media Breakdown.

That's all true I guess but two things can be true at once.  What if I told you that Baby Boy is the most insightful movie about black masculinity of its era, that it's the late John Singleton's most ambitious work?  Give me some grace and about 50 minutes and I'm going to give you a reason to give the film another look.  Baby Boy is one of the most important movies to come out from its era and deserves more respect!

Fiq is switching things up with the good old Face Reveal, stepping in front of the camera to talk about one of the most interesting modern tropes in media right now, the impossible white man.  

The impossible white man trope was coined by Rod of ""The Black Guy Who Tips"" Podcast, and it basically described your typical action hero... but Fiq takes a more analytical look at the who's and the why's of the trope by looking at its core features, history, and subversions (like the fact that many impossible white men aren't white... or men). 

In doing so we learn a bit about modern masculinity by looking at movies like John Wick, Die Hard, Tenet, and even the popularity of Isekais.  All that along with a nice trip down memory lane for all of the other aging millennials out there.

It's a bitter disappointment for me as a man with a healthy love for the character. However, DC's newest stumble out of the gate is bad in a way that is a bit more concerning that it's other failures.  Either Patty Jenkins, or the studio, or someone really didn't sit down to think about the optics and concepts that were being displayed on the screen, and because of this, the movie's ""woke"" subtext really really comes off wrong.

On this episode of Light Work Fiq reacts to what was going through his head as he turned on his HBO GO account to stream this movie.  He breakdown what really happened and what with wrong, including the worst type of ""easter egg"" a movie can have (when you find something you wished you wouldn't.) He watched Wonder Woman run through the greatest hits of irresponsible white feminism and neuvo wokeness, and breaks down why this doesn't work and why the movie is worse for it.

My problem with K-Pop (Light work # 5),2020-10-26T11:00:08Z,PT8M57S,124244,13082,N/A,F.D Signifier,UCgi2u-lGY-2i2ubLsUr6FbQ,"Update- I want to take a moment to recognize that the unfortunate suicide of Sulli and Hara that is referred to in this video was a product of the K-pop industry as a whole.  In retrospect, considering the complex mechanisms that are involved with suicide, I wish in retrospect that I had chosen another way of illustrating the problems with the corporate idol manufacturing system in Korea.  Although it is reasonable to blame their industry for the psychological pressure that these women were under, it was irresponsible of me to use it to make this point.  Thank you to the viewers who pointed this out for me.

K-pop is the hottest music genre on a global scale, and really the only non-American music product that is being consumed around the world, including here in the states.  Acts like BTS, BlackPink, EXO, 2ne1, Big Bang, and Girls Generation may not be known to you, but it's quite possible your son, daughter, niece, or nephew is quite familiar. K-pop has taken the world (and youtube) by storm spawning a billion dollar industry, albums, mangas, fashion, reality tv, react videos, and almost anything else you can sell.  It's taken on a life that hasn't been seen in the states since the 90s, and it's fans are some of the most awesome and hardcore fans out there. 

Fiq has dabbled in K-pop and although enjoying it, noticed something was a bit off about it.  Specifically he couldn't quite figure out why the colorful visuals, great dance moves, and catchy smooth tracks just didn't sit right with him half of the time.

Then it finally started to make sense...

Why Lebron Really is a King Amongst Men (Light Work #3),2020-10-12T02:56:01Z,PT8M53S,25562,2542,N/A,F.D Signifier,UCgi2u-lGY-2i2ubLsUr6FbQ,"Lebron James just won his 4th NBA Championship with his 3rd team (in the middle of me editing this!)  He did it in a season marred by a global pandemic, massive civil unrest, and the biggest civil rights movement we've seen in 50 years.  This should end the debate on who the GOAT is between Lebron and Michael Jordan.  But of course it won't.  The question is why?  Well in this video Fiq presents a hypothesis on how the way Lebron performs masculinity will always render him secondary in the eyes of some of his critics.  More will be explained after the jump in this episode of light work. 


Transcript

In my opinion, Lebron James is the greatest athlete of all time.  Not just better than Jordan and Kobe, but also, Brady, Iron Mike, Babe, Willie, Serena, Agasi, Tiger, Phelps, and whomever is good at hockey.  And I know immediately there will be people who bristle at this notion, and I get that.
My opinion on any sport that isn’t football should be taken with enough salt to cause hypertension, so feel free to not just disagree but completely ignore my ranking of Lebron.  However there’s one thing that’s inarguable, in terms of redefining what an athlete is for the modern era, there is no athlete that has done more than Lebron James has. And I think for a portion of his haters, this undeniable truth is also a significant reason why he has received so much criticism.
There are legitimate reasons to dislike lebron as a player, or at least to say he’s not as good as Jordan or Kobe was in their heyday.  And maybe the majority of his detractors rely on these reasons, But there’s also an undercurrent of criticism that speaks to something bigger than the sport.  I’m not just speaking to how all icons will always have vocal detractors, or the racists and bigots that he persistently triggers with his outspoke political opinions, which have not always been above reproach.  I think the issue under the surface here is about what Lebron represents as a man especially as a man at the very top of a masculine hierarchy.  It’s what greatly seperates him from the other athletes who attain GOAT status.  What am I getting at?  What aside from the flopping and numerous finals losses differentiates Lebron and fuels a significant portion of his criticism.  That’s what I’m going to explain today with a little bit of light work.

I grew up in Chicago in the 90s which meant that the spectacle of Micheal Jordan was a significant part of my childhood.  I sometimes wonder what that must have looked like to the rest of the world.  Probably not all that different to be honest.  Jordan was like the sun, he was so ubiqoutos it dodn’t matter what perspective you witnessed him from, he was going to shine bright, Jordan changed what it meant to be a professional athlete.  
However, there’s one thing that I knew growng up in Chicago that maybe most of the world wasn’t aware of until this past spring with the release of Last Dance.  Jordan was kind of awful as a person.  
I think this is probably the key to his superstardom, the fact that Jordan the NBA, and his handlers were able to so successfully hide the fact that Jordan was kind of a dick.  It’ helps that Jordan’s vice was just being competitive and singleminded and not drugs or women so he never courted severe scandals.  But the reality is that the smiling vibrant Jordan that was sold hid the sociopathic tendencies that drove him to greatness.
If you know sports, then you know that jordan’s intensity is not unique.  It seems like in order to maintain the level of focus and competitiveness needed to be a true icon, you can’t just be good at the sport, you can’t just be a hard worker, you have to legit have a few screws loose to never relent, to always keep an edge. This is seen in almost every athlete I mentioned.  The best of them just seem a bit off, and the wosrt of them had ugly and unfortunate scandals follow them.
Most of them… except Lebron.  To me, this is at the core of Lebron’s criticism.  It’s not an explicit thing, I don’t think that many dudes are consciously aware of how this difference affects their perception, but I definitely think this is a key ingredient.
Athletes are our modern day warrior class. And Throughout history, civilizations have always been perfectly fine with accepting flaws and collateral damage from men who act as warriors and gladiators. If you were a spartan, or gladiator, or bull fighter, or soldier, then society will give allowances for you sometimes breaking other social contracts.  And on some level that makes sense.

Sony's new home console system is coming out on November 18th, and it's likely you've been seeing a ton of memes about men looking to their women to make this purchase on their behalf.  It's also likely you've thought to yourself... why is this a thing?

Well it's not just because the PS5 has amazing hardware or games like Spiderman with Miles Morales, Resident Evil 8 or of course eventually new versions of God of War, Madden, and 2K.  It's not just cause brothas don't have 500 laying around, and it's not just another silly meme...well it is, but if you dig deeper, you see some other things at play.

Light Work #1: Hamilton's B Sides,2020-09-28T11:00:03Z,PT6M22S,52364,4197,N/A,F.D Signifier,UCgi2u-lGY-2i2ubLsUr6FbQ,"Light work episodes are meant to be smaller bite sized commentaries on topics that really don't have enough meat to make into full videos.  This episode is all about my reaction to a song left on the cutting room floor from Disney's Hamilton.  After my analysis video on Hamilton (link in the description, I did some further searching and came across a song that shows that my criticism was not completely out of the blue.  Lin Manuel Miranda seemed to be aware of the problematic nature of his award winning and record breaking work of genius.  Does this new song change my opinion or confirm it?  Will it change yours?

One Hitter Quitter! #3: Antebellum (2020) Review,2020-09-21T11:00:18Z,PT10M47S,45495,3627,N/A,F.D Signifier,UCgi2u-lGY-2i2ubLsUr6FbQ,"In the spirit of Jordan Peele’s Get Out, and the upcoming Candyman, here comes Antebellum, a 2020 movie brought straight to streaming as another movie victim of the COVID-19 pandemic.  However, the movie itself might be Its own unique plague.  It's a hot mess. Starring the amazing Janelle Monae tight roping to do her best to save a poorly thought out premise, Antebellum comes up very VERY short of its racial horror predecessors.  So should you pay or wait to watch this movie?  Check out this review of Antebellum (2020) as Fiq the Signifier gives his best reaction to why you wouldn’t survive watching this awful movie in today’s 1 Hitter Quitter.

Black Media Breakdown #4: How Issa Rae writes black men : Video Essay,2020-08-31T11:52:16Z,PT26M31S,639407,32933,N/A,F.D Signifier,UCgi2u-lGY-2i2ubLsUr6FbQ,"Quick announcement update... i am very sorry for saying the show was centered in the Bay area.  My bad yall.  Please feel free to drag me as needed for my mistake.  But i am aware of the mistake lol. 

Issa Rae’s Insecure sets a new standard for black dramedy.  I’ve tuned in every night on HBO to see what her and Yvonne Orji (aka the character Molly) get into.  But at the same time I’ve also found myself captivated and motivated by the way Issa writes black men.  Issa’s come a long way from Awkward Black Girl to visions of black love in The Photograph or good ol fashioned comedy hijinks with a fellow future icon (Marsai Martin) in Little and with Kumail Nanjiani in Lovebirds, or just standing around being extra fly and Black in Jay Z's Moonlight.  But it’s her creation of characters like Baby Voice Darius, Thug Yoda, Jared and of course Lawrence that puts her in rarified air for the way she represents black men on the big and small screen.
So in this episode of Black Media Breakdown Fiq plants his flag as a member of the Lawrence fanbase and reacts to the ways in which Issa gets and represents men on screen better than anyone else in the game!

Excuse the slight downgrade in audio, I'm still working out the kinks to my recording process.  This is the first of a two-part series with part two hopefully coming out in two weeks!
