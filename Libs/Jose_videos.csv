The Slough Branch: The Office Retrospective,2024-02-23T18:04:58Z,PT1H14M49S,72525,2787,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"I'm not thrilled with the title for this video, but the only alternative I could think of was ""The British Version of The Office"", and that's too obvious a troll.

I first saw The Office way back around the time it premiered. It certainly had this real air of prestige around it, and seemed to be the show everyone was talking about. Over time, the British version has faded from people's minds in a way the American one hasn't. Maybe darker, more cynical shows are more easily forgotten when there's a happier alternative. Or maybe it just didn't have enough episodes to persist in syndication. Whatever the reason, this video looks back at how this show holds up today, and what it still has to say.

Secondary sources should appear on screen as they're cited. In addition to the interviews I cited in the video, background information on the status of British television was informed by the Walters book as well.

"Reviewing Lady Ballers, The Daily Wire's Attempt at Comedy",2024-01-29T16:50:09Z,PT35M22S,286693,12054,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"The Daily Wire tried to make a comedy about trans women in sports. And the result is pretty much the disaster you'd imagine it to be.

Sorry everyone for the long wait for this, but much of that was out of my hands. I'm not 100% happy with this cut of the video, but it's the best version of it I could get online. I hope people enjoy it regardless.

Bentkey: The Daily Wire's Kids Streamer,2023-12-08T18:26:55Z,PT46M31S,235052,9785,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"Bentkey was more interesting to cover than I expected. The shows themselves are pretty shallow, but the platform and what it might mean for the Daily Wire in the future could be very consequential. Its failure could seriously damage the company, and its success would be a major boon. So far it seems like it's trending towards failure. So if the Daily Wire crashes and burns, it'll be the children who didn't watch it that made the world a better place.

While it shows its age in some moments, many of the jokes and its style really hold up.

This is one of the most requested shows I've had for a while, and it's nice to finally be covering it here. I hope everyone enjoys it!

A lot of this commentary focuses on the past, though I do check in with more recent information as a point of comparison.

It does get pretty technical in some parts, but hopefully it's not too confusing. It should also be considered a start into this kind of investigation, as I'm hoping people more experienced in this kind of content creation (streaming specifically) might be able to delve deeper into the shenanigans happening over on Rumble.

Jesse Watters As Fox News' Next Big Guy,2023-08-19T18:24:49Z,PT46M56S,231353,8706,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"If you took Fox News and molded it into a man, you'd get Jesse Watters. Jesse Watters is a weird guy to watch. He isn't very bright, or charming, or particularly provocative, but he somehow embodies the worst of the network.

This video looks at the first week of his new 8 PM time slot. Some other episodes are drawn in for further context, but the picture should give you a good idea of what he's all about. With some confidence, I think I can say he's a guy who won't require much close watching in the future. He doesn't have the power of his predecessors, and if you have an idea of what Fox News is saying on its network, you know what Watters is going to say.

That said, it's possible he got suffer a gaff that brings his career crashing down. But more like I suspect he'll get got with something backstage going wrong. I suppose we'll see in time.

This look back at the series examines its origins and messages throughout its entire seven year run. From its early days on ABC to its final episodes on the WB.

This show resonating with me a lot when I was younger. Maybe it was just my crush on Melissa Joan Hart, but I think it also offered some unique laughs and fun magical quirks. Definitely a show of its era.

When I was younger I used to watch a lot of ""documentaries"" that were glorified conspiracy theories. The production on these movies has really improved over the years, though the content has somehow gotten worse. I remember watching ""What in the World Are They Spraying?"" and thinking it was doing a very bad job trying to convince me that chemtrails were real. In comparison, the movies I cover in this video, ""2000 Mules"", ""Died Suddenly"", and ""No Safe Spaces"" are so much weaker. There were scenes I thought must be included as a joke, yet somehow made it in as evidence.

This video debunks some of the claims in these movies and also explores the wider world of the marketplace that creates them. I hope we can think of them not as individually bad, but as cumulatively much worse.

Think Local: A Parks and Recreation Retrospective,2023-03-18T15:00:01Z,PT1H53M30S,627082,15535,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"Parks and Recreation was a show I remembered aging poorly. Much to my delight, it held up better than I thought it would. While at times it feels too much like a liberal fantasy, there's enough in there to remind you that it's responding to the real world with its own brand of optimism for a better tomorrow.

Sometimes I think we lose sight of simple concepts like hope because of their associations. While context matters for TV shows, we can't let that define everything about them.

Well, have I got a book for you today. Aside from the shocking nature of the material, I, along with some friends, go into detail on why this particular book is poorly written slop.

But because of a very dedicated fanbase, and the love of critics, it was kept relevant for many years after. Although originally considered an instant classic, the fourth and fifth seasons complicate that legacy, and raise the question of whether or not a show's divisive return can influence the way people look at the whole series.

The was originally going to just be a look at The End of Men, but I decided it might be more interesting looking at the whole thing, and trying to make sense of it all.

I've done the best job I could to censor out some graphic imagery, so expect a couple of title cards blocking out specific scenes of that. If you want to watch the originals, please be aware that it gets incredibly graphic in certain parts.

Hanging Out: A That 70s Show Retrospective,2022-10-22T21:45:12Z,PT1H41M50S,862885,21874,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"I remember watching That 70s Show when it premiered, and even though I was a bit younger than the teens on it, I felt a sort of kindship with them. I may not have grown up in the 1970s, or even been alive, but their stories felt a lot like what I expected my teen years to be. And looking back, in some ways that was kind of right.

This video looks back at the highs and lows of the series. How it transformed throughout its eight seasons, and how it didn't. And how it has lived on since going off the air.

I can't say for certain how it'll turn out, but I'm a bit skeptical of their chances at success.

I have no idea if I'll be reviewing any more Daily Wire movies in the future, largely because they haven't even announced what their next one will be. Apparently it's very hard for them to find a decent script, though if I had to hazard a guess, I think it's also hard for them to find a script they can finance.

These are some ridiculous books. Words cannot express how crazy some of this all is, but I gave it a shot.

To answer what I'm sure people will be asking in the comments, yes, the art in these books is terrible. Matt Walsh's book in particular is bad, though that may be, in part, because the pdf version is shoddily put together. The hard copy isn't much better though, and I couldn't be bothered tracking down a physical copy of the thing.

A Touch of Class: A Frasier Retrospective,2022-06-30T23:08:28Z,PT1H48M14S,1102784,19663,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"Unlike Cheers, Frasier was a show I actually watched when I was younger. Revisiting was surprising, insofar that it held up better than I expected, even if it very much is a reflection of where sitcoms were in the 90's.

This is the second longest show I've covered, so I'm sure people will notice I missed a lot of stuff. But I did my best to get everything I could in there. All the videos I referenced are linked below.

Also, a tip of the hat to ""Frasier: A Cultural History"" by Joseph J. Darowski and Kate Darowski for being particularly useful when doing research on this video.

Religious Right Commentary and the Rise of Elijah Schaffer,2022-06-04T19:12:30Z,PT51M46S,214558,9906,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"Elijah Schaffer is not a name a ton of people know, but he's a prime example of how someone can rise to a degree of prominence in the right-wing media space. These positions aren't created to accommodate talent, but rather seek out people to fill specific roles, advancing specific narratives.

This video looks at some of the history that allows this happens, and then uses Schaffer as a case study of what that career looks like, and the hateful agenda it pushes.

This is a very lazy book that probably could have been funny if it had been put together by more talented comedians. There isn't a whole lot more to say than that.

"The Jimmy Dore Show, What Bad Leftwing Critique Looks Like",2022-02-08T14:46:26Z,PT45M1S,287655,11914,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"I'm not in any way a fan of Jimmy Dore's content. I don't watch his channel regularly, and often when I see his comments online, I'm underwhelmed at best. He isn't particularly funny, insightful, or interesting to me. Watching his channel for a few weeks didn't really change my mind. 

I can understand his appeal insofar that he provides an emotional release for people. He expresses a rage that represents the frustration a lot of people have with the system. And I don't think being angry is a bad thing. But good political commentary needs more than rage. It needs to engage with the facts in an honest and accurate way. It needs to provide direction and focus. It needs to not be counterproductive and empowering to even worse forces than the ones you're criticizing. This is where Jimmy Dore's content fails.

I think this video does an OK job of evidencing that.

Thank You For Being A Friend: Remembering The Golden Girls,2022-01-23T22:00:00Z,PT1H29M56S,1286249,22591,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"This video came together both quicker and slower than I expected. Originally I was hoping to release it on Betty White's hundredth birthday, but sadly she passed away shortly after I recorded the audio. Although this video is dedicated to her, I also want to acknowledge the work of Bea Arthur, Rue McClanahan and Estelle Getty, whose talents cannot be understated.

For anyone who watches these videos and wonder if they should seek out the series I'm talking about on their own; I strongly recommend checking this one out. Much of the humour holds up surprisingly well, and the more somber moments still hit cleanly. Certain aspects haven't aged well, but compared to some other shows I've covered, this one has more hits than misses.

In honour of Betty White, please consider a donation to American Humane. Betty White was an active member for over sixty years.

I was delightfully surprised at how well written it was, and how strong all the performances were. Particularly in those early seasons when the whole Sam and Diane dynamic was in full swing. Chemistry that good on screen really does feel like lightning in a bottle, the rare treat you only get to see once in a long while. I hope I was able to represent it well in this video.

That said, I did learn some stuff about how he puts his show together, and just how thick the nonsense is, so I figured I'd share.

This video covers the week of October 18, 2021. Some of the information may be out of date, but I did the best I could with what I could find at the time. If any corrections need to be made, let me know in the comments below.

Are Politics More Important Than Friendship?,2021-09-26T21:00:14Z,PT19M37S,112404,6299,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"Friendships are valuable, but how do they weigh against the values of someone's politics? And how does what we call ""politics"" impact our friendships? And if someone is engaging in political work, is there for friendly relationships with rivals?

These are some of the questions I had in mind while making this video. I don't think I provide any concrete answers, but hopefully it'll give anyone who watches this something to think about when it comes to friendships and politics.

The Baby-Sitters Club Is Starting The Revolution...And I'm Here For It (with Mexie!),2021-09-14T16:00:11Z,PT27M52S,60174,3620,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"I have no idea if we'll see a revolution in our lifetime, but if we do, I want the Baby-Sitters Club's in charge.


This is my first ever collab, and it was an absolute blast to put together. It helped that both Mexie and I love the Netflix series. It's a show for a younger audience, but is such an absolute joy to watch that I recommend it to anyone. So even if this video has some spoilers, please give the show a watch!

Conservative Nonfiction Nonsense,2021-08-13T16:26:58Z,PT36M47S,529437,20686,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"I'm taking a break from reading fiction to delve into the murky waters of conservative nonfiction. These books were mostly chosen at random, so I didn't expect them to tie together so easily. But it turns out most of these books are all the same. Just to varying degrees of quality, from bad to worse.

I move through everything a bit quickly in this video, so I'm not sure I gave the arguments quite enough time to breathe, but if people like this video, I might track down another nonfiction book and really dig into it.

How Do We Talk About The Cosby Show? A Retrospective,2021-07-15T01:37:05Z,PT1H49M25S,889393,24364,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"This one was tough. Watching the show was a simple enough process, but the many, many different critiques, commentaries, and academic papers I read added a lot of time to making what is now my longest video ever. And to make it even tougher, Bill Cosby was released from prison when I was nearly done the whole thing. I inserted a bit of extra info to include that information, but if he's done or said anything terrible since it happened (which seems likely), the video won't include that information.

0:00 - Intro
1:18 - Before The Cosby Show
6:59 - Meet The Huxtables
12:23 - The Early Years, Seasons 1-3

Reviewing a Terrible Conservative Comedy About Bernie Sanders,2021-05-22T18:04:04Z,PT26M52S,312100,13332,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"Buckle up everyone, this is not going to be an easy movie to talk about. 

Free Lunch Express is...technically a movie. About Bernie Sanders. Kind of. It's really just a cheap caricature, the sort you'd expect in a bad right wing satire. Which is exactly what this movie is. But let's not pretend Bernie Sanders is some saintly figure we can't laugh at. If someone can poke fun at him in a funny way, there's no harm in that, right? Well, that's where this movie falls apart. Not a single moment can be described as ""funny"", and even at 80 minutes, manages to be a complete waste of time.

My little review compares it to some other satirical biopics about politicians, all of which offer more realistic portrayals of their subjects (except maybe the last one) and all of which are better movies. Some moreso than others.

It was also pretty darn funny. And thanks to its use of practical effects, it's also aged visually considerably well too.

This video is a look at some of the major themes that ran through this short-lived series, only lasting a mere four seasons, including one of the most memorable finales in TV history.

Can We Just Not Care?,2021-03-26T20:01:55Z,PT13M20S,83381,6780,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"This one is going to be more of an op-ed type.


I've always hated this presumption that people on the left don't genuinely care about things. This is distinct from whether or not someone is a grifter, but rather the idea that no one could possibly care about the things people on the left claim to care about. It's an insidious way the right tries to get people to tune us out entirely.

This video is light on sources because these are mostly my own opinions. Undoubtedly influenced by people I've watched in the past, but I had nothing and no one specific in mind when I was writing this. If you see echoes of someone in it, feel free to leave a comment below. Maybe (probably) someone has said all this better than I have here.

The Many Lies of Crossfire,2021-02-27T22:08:09Z,PT47M43S,168811,8201,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"This video was less fun to make than I expected. Borderless was interesting to go through because it was a narrower topic, letting me focus on modern refugee processes, and the impact of refugees on European countries, all from the perspective of the (then) modern day. Crossfire blisters through decades of history, and then touches on so many different aspects of policing and crime that it never really settles on one topic for too long.

This movie seems designed to confuse the audience with a barrage of information. My response, I worry, may have a similar effect with regard to modern day policing and crime. My main purpose here was to show that Crossfire is a movie not worth taking seriously, and if you want to understand the origin of the BLM protests, you're better off looking elsewhere.

"Run Hide Fight, Looking at The Daily Wire's First Movie",2021-01-31T21:00:10Z,PT36M50S,462954,19649,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"This is a sad video. Yes, there are some jokes at the expense of a terrible movie, but it turns out a school shooting is not ripe territory for humour. And the last couple of minutes when things get real are particularly tough. I inserted a fairly heavy handed warning at that part of the video, so please take it seriously if you only tuned in to watch a video about a bad movie.

Originally this video was going to open with a joke about Ben Shapiro inspiring a shooting, but honestly, there are enough downers in this video that it didn't need another reminder of a tragedy. At the very least, I'm happy I was able to have this one go out on a laugh. That particular clip will probably come up in a future video.

The comparison between The Joker and Tristan was first made in a review of Run Hide Fight from The Daily Telegraph (linked below), but was slightly expanded upon by me.

How Tim Pool Keeps His Audience Ignorant,2021-01-16T03:00:11Z,PT43M25S,455528,20039,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"Here we are, back with Tim Pool once again. He's one of those black holes of misinformation that I couldn't help but get pulled back. This was supposed to be a much smaller video, but clearly I had a lot to say. And quite a bit had to be cut. I would have more time to really dig into Tim content in a kinder (crueler?) world, but this is the only world we've got.


The original version of this video started off with a fun joke about someone asking me if I was going to spend another week watching Tim Pool videos, and I asked if they were making some kind of threat. It was good. But reality means we don't get to be funny, so now there's a disclaimer about the Capitol attack on January 6th.

Due to a lot of quick updates, and the timeliness of this video, the overall product is a little rough around the edges compared to some of my other videos. But if no one notices that, let's just say my videos were never very slick to begin with.

It's a little light on behind the scenes info because there was relatively little drama or turbulence. From what I could gather, a bunch of people who got along put a show together, and that's pretty much it.

The show itself was fun to revisit, particularly since I hadn't really watched the later episodes, so a lot of them were first-time experiences for me. 

There were a few cuts made to this video, but it largely comes here with minimal changes. I hope people enjoy it!

Building Voter Fraud Conspiracy Theories with Steven Crowder,2020-11-21T19:00:10Z,PT22M24S,231925,12218,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"I had the idea for a video like this over a year ago, but I couldn't settle on the conspiracy theory to do it on. Luckily Steven Crowder settled that for me by releasing a huge stream that embodied the entire ""Just Asking Questions"" technique. Please keep in mind that this technique isn't necessarily deliberate, but in Crowder's case, I think it might be motivated by financial success. At least on an unconscious level. And remember, you don't have to be liar to be full of crap.

I believe (but was not 100% sure) that the red wagon claim had its own video on Crowder's channel, but was taken down after it was exposed to be obviously not true. But the five hour stream it premiered in is still very much up as I upload this video. It's also filled with similarly bogus claims that do not substantiate voter fraud at all. But a huge video like that, with over five million views, isn't something you take down just because it's bogus. Why give up that sweet revenue, right?

"No, Gillette Did Not Lose $8 Billion Because of a ""Woke"" Ad",2020-11-11T16:02:34Z,PT14M33S,101729,6678,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"The video digs a little deeper than the title suggests, but only slightly. I wanted to get this one done fast because it'd been buzzing in my head for such a long time. And people keep saying the thing, so I wanted to have a video explaining why they should stop saying the thing.


I meant to make this video a year ago, but always thought it should be a part of something bigger. But I kept holding off, thinking it could never work as a video on its own. I took to Twitter to ask the people, not really giving away the idea, and they said to do it. And now we have it. The video I didn't think I should make, but ended up turning up OK.


Something funny I didn't get to include in the video is that, while the ad got a poor reaction on YouTube, it actually did very well on Facebook and other social media platforms. It seemed like YouTube was the one place where people hated the idea of toxic masculinity being called out. Makes you think, huh?

Yo Homes to Bel Air: A Retrospective of The Fresh Prince of Bel Air,2020-10-15T23:00:23Z,PT1H31M51S,789075,20275,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"I have a confession to make. Of all the sitcoms I've done retrospectives on, this is the first one I genuinely watched like crazy when I was a kid. I thought Will Smith was the coolest guy in the world, and when I was trying to figure out which superhero should be my favourite, the idea that Will Smith read Spider-Man (on the show) was good enough for me.

While working on this video I made a prediction to myself on the future of Fresh Prince reboot, and I'm a little sad I couldn't get this video out before my prediction came true. That said, I'm happy to have included actual news instead of a prediction, so you all get accurate information instead of me puffing my chest out.

And by written, I mean came up with the ideas for, and then had an actual writer write. This one is all him though, and it shows. It's more dull than funny, but I found some stuff to talk about.


One thing that's a little tough to see in this video is how tiny this book is. It fits into small hands, which makes me think it might be for children, but I would be surprised if any child enjoyed listening to this thing. On the other hand, it would definitely put them to sleep.

In spite of its enormous size, I had to cut over twenty-five minutes of content from this video, and that was down from a heavily edited script. There was so much to say about this series, and it was difficult limiting myself to only the most important parts.


Some aspects I would have loved to cover are Kelly's story arc from high school student to working woman. Or Bud's attempt to free himself from the life of a Bundy. Even Peggy's many adventures, often including her family, would have been worth touching on. I can't believe I didn't mention Peg's mother once in this whole video!


This video was a struggle to get online. From tech issues to YouTube hurdles. But I'm so glad to finally get a chance to share it with everyone. It went through dozens of iterations, and while it isn't perfect, I do hope you enjoy it. Considering the enormous effort this one took, I hope anyone who enjoys it considers becoming a patron. It was a labour of love, but it would be nice if I could afford some better tools to make this stuff.

Why People Hate in Gundam Seed,2020-08-03T22:11:57Z,PT21M27S,123263,5024,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"Gundam Seed is one of those shows that was immensely popular when it debuted, but has since left people's minds. Maybe it seems less relevant, or maybe it's just the product of the endless series of Gundam shows that have shown up to take its place. Regardless, I think it's worth remembering.

Fans of Gundam Seed might notice I make almost no mention of Gundam Seed Destiny. Aside from the fact that I didn't want to watch it again, I also wanted to focus on the superior first series. I have no plans on making a video about GSD for the foreseeable future.

How Protesters Hit By Drivers Are Vilified,2020-07-26T22:16:25Z,PT17M58S,55451,4776,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"This video may contain information that is out of date as it discusses a case that is currently unfolding. Although the case itself is an important one, I would rather underline the importance of how incidents like the death of Summer Taylor, or any protester injured by a vehicle, are manipulated to dismiss what they stood for, and undermine the very notion of peaceful protest.

One thing I could have made clearer in the video is how marginalized groups aren’t simply denied access to platforms because of their identities, but because of their status in society as a result of those identities. This is an issue of class and identity, and how they intersect to create an imbalance in power when it comes to access to media platforms, and how effectively they can exercise their right to free expression.

And yes, I am one of those annoying people who prefers Free Expression to Free Speech. There are so many charming words in the English language and I like to use a lot of them. I likes me some free expression.

Why Some Cops Think They're The Punisher,2020-06-20T21:30:00Z,PT14M46S,427802,23959,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"This is a brief video on why cops are wearing The Punisher's logo. I had wanted to go into a few other things, such as how a certain right wing militia also used the logo, though I was worried it would have gotten a bit off track.

For the record, I do enjoy The Punisher as a character in limited amounts, but I've always found the fandom around the character to be problematic. Some of the comments from police and military personnel in particular were worrying. I only shared a few in this video, but far too many people see this morally grey (at best) character as some ultimate arbiter of right and wrong. The idea of a deeply flawed man somehow being perfect at dispensing final justice seems like wish fulfillment in a lot of ways, so I can understand why someone would want to believe that. I think it would be better for people to raise their aspirations a little higher though, looking at character who reshape the world, instead of transforming themselves into something above it all.



For such a short video, this one sure has a lot of links.

"The Camp of the Saints, An Introduction to the Worst Book",2020-05-30T18:09:33Z,PT41M54S,213264,7116,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"The reason this is an introduction rather than a review is that, while other novels I’ve covered have been light reads, this is a denser text. So much denser that it would require a very deep critical dive to do it justice. It’s written with a great degree of care and skill, and is also completely horrific in how it sees the world. If there’s enough demand, I may have to do a follow-up video offering a deeper reading, and a look at how this text has impacted the immigration debate over the decades. Let me know in the comments if you’d like to see that!


This video probably would have been more timely two years ago, when the Syrian refugee crisis was in full swing, but I suspect we’ll be hearing about it again if Climate Change has a similar impact on the movement of people.

There’s some light religion talk in this one, and none of it is designed to offend. I’m talking about a very specific branch of Christianity, and while I couldn’t quite find which denomination it was (I've since been told his rhetoric most closely aligns with the Society of Saint Pius X, although he isn't a member), I am not trying to present this book’s vision of Christianity as mainstream.

Finally, I don’t remember if I mentioned it in the video, but I did not purchase this book, so no money went to Jean Raspail. Hooray!

PragerU Is Conservative Junk Food,2020-04-30T01:37:35Z,PT17M33S,430990,20384,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"Another quick video, this time looking at PragerU, a channel I had always told myself I would never bother with. Well, here we are, trapped in a pandemic and me unable to get my exciting big videos out any quicker. So I guess it's PragerU time.

Here's a fun fact: The working title for this video was ""PragerU vid I guess"".

This video's structure is a bit weird, and I think my overall message is muddled. That said, it's a fun ride, and maybe some people will enjoy it. There is a dad joke in the cold open though, so fair warning if you're someone who reads the description before watching the video.

Racists Only Have One Solution,2020-04-10T01:35:16Z,PT17M16S,279496,12340,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"As we live through the pandemic, I put together a short (for me) response to a common talking point I see from a few popular figures online. The topic of borders in particular is being used to stealthily introduce anti-immigration talking points deliberately targeting people of colour. They should sound familiar because they use these talking points as answers to every problem. It’s because they don’t care about solving problems, they see them as means to their eventual ends, an ethno state.


This video was put together in about two days, so it’s a little rough around the edges. Hopefully it’s not too terrible though.

"Reviewing Glenn Beck's Garbage Novel, The Overton Window",2020-02-22T20:00:10Z,PT45M10S,306504,9213,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"This is one of Glenn Beck’s seven (!) novels. Honestly I regret choosing this one because the Santa/Jesus crossover book sounds so much more amusing. That said, I’m pretty sure the Christmas ones are much worse. This one has a sequel, The Eye of Moloch, which I may get around to some day, but I’m in no rush. From what it sounds like, it was actually the second half of this story, which explains why it ends so suddenly. There was also a stage production of this book. It was done ironically though, so I figured I could skip it.

I was disheartened to learn how little of his books Glenn actually writes. I think that’s what kept is from getting into some really awful crap. Ultimately it’s not as bad as Ben Shapiro’s novel because of that. And that was disappointing.

I added some context for people unfamiliar with who Glenn Beck was/is, and why he still matters today. Some of the history may not be exact, and I may have played down the racist elements of the Tea Party movement, but the important part is how it shaped politics today. Acting like a giant weight against progress.

In finishing this video, I feel like there's so much more to say about Tim Pool, but I don't think I can quite bring myself to cover any of his content for the foreseeable future. A broader look at his work, and his origins, I think would help contextualize this very determined effort he's making to produce some truly awful commentary.


I know my opinion that he's at least partially genuine is at odds with some people who see him as a pure grifter, but I don't know if the degree of ineptitude he displays is something that can be faked. If it's all an act, and he's suckered me, I have to give him total credit for being so utterly convincing as a man completely out of his depth.

I'm writing this description weird. Hopefully it works for someone though!

I'm not going to lie everyone, this video genuinely hurt to make. Each day watching this content was pain. Usually I can develop a numbness, but when it's something new that's stupid every day, it really wears you down over time.

As a general caveat, I have not watched every single Tim Pool video he’s ever produced on any of the topics I’ll be covering. But I suspect no one but a few tie-hard Tim-heads have done that. If Tim wants people to have greater context for any of his comments by scouring his back catalogue, he needs to learn how to be more explicit about what videos provide the context he’s not including.

It was one of the top 10 rated shows on television during its entire eight season run, though it hasn’t lived on in hearts and minds as the few select shows that live on in eternal syndication. That said, people still have some warm feelings for it, and I explore some of my more complicated feelings in this retrospective.


I wanted to open this description with a grunt, but I have no idea how write those out (ough ough?)


A little over a third of you who voted in the pole I had should be happy to be seeing this result, but for the rest of you, I haven’t completely turned my back on other options, I’m just taking a short break from making these very time consuming videos to focus on some other projects.

Reviewing Ben Shapiro's Garbage Short Story Collection,2019-10-21T01:00:10Z,PT37M22S,164864,7337,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"Back with another look at terrible Conservative literature. Maybe this should become a series.

This time I’ll be discussing three short stories written by Ben Shapiro. They’re pretty bad. 

This book was published a year before his novel, though I suspect Ben wrote some of these when he was much younger. They reveal a lack of maturity, and the faintest glimmer of talent. But more often than not it’s dashed into oblivion by the heavy hand of his ham-fisted ideological tilts. 

I believe, and have certainly read, many great works of literature by conservative authors. The reason this one fails isn’t because of what it believes, but it’s inability to portray those beliefs in a meaningful story. As much as I disagree with Ben Shapiro politically, that’s not (entirely) what’s wrong with these stories. The main problem is Ben is just really bad at putting together a story.
Someone please tell him to write more. The pain is starting to feel good.

Ben Shapiro writes bad books, but only one is clearly mark as fiction. This disturbing vision presents a world filled with terrorism, liberals, and people of colour, wrapped in the sickly package of spotty prose and confused plotting. Characters vanish from the plot without a trace, narrative threads go nowhere, and the basic facts of each character’s history change from chapter to chapter.

At first I was wondering why this book didn’t have a copy editor, but by the end I was convinced there was no editor at all. Or if this editor existed, instead of working on improving this book, they must have turned to drinking and fallen into a deep depression to think that their life had come to this point.

Everyone and anyone who helped perpetrate this fiasco of a novel should be ashamed of themselves.

All that said, it made me laugh.

What Ever Happened To Murphy Brown?,2019-08-31T00:00:09Z,PT1H15M21S,192569,6092,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"Murphy Brown was a favourite of mine when I was a kid. I grew up watching it as part of a block of syndicated sitcoms back in the 90’s, though it left syndication before I got to watch the last two seasons. For some reason I always remembered that vision of Murphy Brown coming in from the snow, whipping off the loose flakes as she flung her scarf off of her parka.

Rewatching this series was a lot of fun, and I hope some of that came across in this video. So many things ended up being cut from this video I could have easily added an extra 30 minutes to it. Maybe I’ll make it into a second video if this one does well enough/if enough people bother me about it.

The sources for this video were largely the series itself, but I owe a huge debt to the book Stealing the Show by Joy Press for some of the background info. There were a few other articles I found scattered through the internet, but this show is primarily my own reading.

I’ve got my next classic sitcom already lined up, waiting for a rewatch. It probably won’t be my next video, but there’s definitely another one of these coming. I hope everyone looks forward to it!

I de-emphasized a few points, and cut a few small ones, but most of my original script managed to get in here intact. I think the length is a bit long, but I found so many interesting bits that added context to this scenario that it felt like it was all worthwhile. In addition to debunking Lauren’s nonsense, I wanted to take the time to actually learn about the various issues surrounding the refugee crisis that was such a big story in 2017. 

I debated whether or not to make this video after Lauren Southern’s announcement that she was leaving public life, but aside from her channel still festering on YouTube, I highly suspect she’ll be back one day, and we shouldn’t forget who she is and the sort of garbage she pushes.

Lauren Chen Said Some Bad Stuff About Refugees,2019-06-29T22:39:10Z,PT16M13S,74099,4299,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"This video is both a throwback to the reply videos I was doing, and an attempt at doing something new. If people enjoy this, please let me know, and I’ll adjust my schedule to fit in quick little replies like this one so no one is waiting 2 months between one of my videos, like with what happened between the Roseanne and Secret Empire ones.

And speaking of those videos, do people prefer reply vids, or do they want more pop-culture stuff? Let me know. I enjoy making both, but if one has a bigger audience than the other, I might divide my time accordingly. I may do another old sitcom sometime. Ideas are always welcome!

My next big video is moving along nicely, and I should have the script done (I hope) in the next few days. I’m just debating how much of a terrible person people can take before they turn off the video. I hope it’s a lot.

Before you follow any of those links below, think about possibly donating to the UNHCR, which, in spite of claims to the contrary, is not flush with cash, and can always use more to help some very vulnerable people.

Why Secret Empire Was Great,2019-06-16T00:58:42Z,PT1H36M11S,158359,6503,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"This marks my biggest video yet. As a story that I think got unfairly maligned due to a plot point, I wanted to take a closer a look at the whole thing, and see if I could pull out something more than the outrage that surrounded it. There's a lot of summarizing in this video for the unfamiliar, but if you haven't read a super comic before, be aware that they're pretty weird.

This will probably be the last comic book-themed video I do for a while. The main reason I’m doing this is because I rarely see anyone defending an event that I thought was pretty good. I don’t address too many critics head-on because, to be honest, most of the critiques weren’t that interesting. They centred on questions about whether it was “worth it” to turn Captain America into a fascist, or generic complaints about Marvel Event fatigue (which I agree with). I also wanted to address the idea that this series wasn’t about anything, or if it was, it wasn’t about anything unique. The idea that it was just another story about a super villain trying to take over America. There was a lot more than that going on underneath the surface.

I also didn’t address the Nick Spencer controversy in this video. What I found in my research was a lot of hearsay without much evidence. The closest I got to him being a proven racist are some questionable comments from 2005 when he ran for office in Cincinnati. Considering that was ten years before this comic was written, I think it’s possible he’s become a better person in that time. Even if he hasn’t, I wanted this video to be about my reading of this comic, and not the personal opinions of its author. Maybe if he was a more publically toxic person there’d be more to say there.

Much thanks to all my vocal talent

It's old, out of date, and made with some terrible audio. Even with those caveats, I think I made a few decent points, albeit in a clumsy way.

I don't have any direct links for my sources on ratings and sales, but those can be easily found online. This was recorded in 2017, so I have no idea how well Sam Bee's show is doing now or how well some of the comics I mentioned are selling. At the time they were doing great though.

I'm also trying a few new visual elements in this video. Any feedback would be nice. 

A real video should be coming in the near future. This one is looking like it'll clock in at nearly 2 hours at the moment. No idea how it'll end up though.

"Roseanne of The Conners (Part 2), From Revival to Reboot",2019-04-26T23:58:42Z,PT47M28S,306125,12386,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"This one took a while. I had hoped to get this uploaded months ago, but here we are in April, so I'm hoping better late than never is acceptable. As for the content, this one ends better than the previous video, though I still wonder if I could have said more about this show, and said it in a less fragmented way. I suppose that's the challenge of trying to find a cohesive message in something that's broken into pieces.

I briefly toyed with the idea of comparing Roseanne and its reboot with Murphy Brown and its reboot, but not only is decent Murphy Brown footage very hard to come by, it's also very difficult to compare hundreds of episodes of TV shows. Also, rewatching Murphy Brown made me think it's a show that's a lot less relevant, since much of its humour is steeped in the pop culture of the time. It might make for an interesting quick video about the declining relevancy of upper class white woman feminism though.

I might take a break from deep dives of TV shows, just because of the amount of time it takes to produce them. That said, if anyone has any ideas for ones they would like to see covered, I'd be happy to listen.

There were many painful cuts in this video's contents, so if you were a fan of the show and are upset I didn't really go into deal about certain aspects of its nine season run, it was either because I didn't have time to fit them in or couldn't find anything interesting to say about them.

This video is probably best understood in the context of the second one I have planned in the future. It probably would have made more sense to just make that one, but I love long winded intros that set the stage. This video even has two of them.

What can I say, my channel is growing too quick for me to keep up with.

Like the last Q and A, I've included some adorable animals as the footage so you all have something lovely to look at. The last Q and A had fewer questions, yet ended up running longer. I think this means I've learned how to more succinct in my answers. Or maybe I just got better at editing out all the hemming and hawing I did in the last video.

Also, a small disclaimer I know no one will read, I used ""Debating the Right"" in my title instead of using the exact phrasing of the question because it's nicer for the algorithm. I don't think everyone on the right is a literal monster.

"Why ""Get Woke, Go Broke"" is a Lie",2019-02-18T20:38:42Z,PT22M24S,189604,7219,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"This is one of those videos that I would never have to make if people stopped and asked “How do we know this is true?”. Most reactionary talking points tend to crumble under this line of questioning, demanding evidence that’s more rigorous than circumstantial events. It also exposes the tendency people have to highlight the times where they could be considered right, and ignore the times where they’re wrong.
A prediction I would have liked to include in this video is that when/if Captian Marvel does well at the box office, no one will ever discuss how it was this super woke movie that was bound to go broke. We’re far more likely to see videos discussing how the lack of SJW messaging is what got audience to go see it. Or rather they went to see the movie in spite of the SJW messaging. It doesn’t matter, they’re just trying to latch their toxic ideas on to a popular media property so they can spread their brand, grow their audience, and make money.
Damn, I should have put that point into the movie.
And one last thing, the “Get Woke, Go Broke” phrase has really bugged for a while. Mostly because it’s a dopey rhyme. I also hate “You do you” and “Make it happen cap’n”.

Paul Joseph Watson's Nazi Problem,2019-01-28T01:43:48Z,PT14M39S,216818,7105,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"I probably should have mentioned this at the very beginning of the video, but I'm not calling Paul Joseph Watson a Nazi in this video. I know some people are very sensitive about that word.

From the French-speakers I asked about the article, I got a variety of impressions about what the Jardin piece was all about. So instead of traipsing into the land of French discourse on sexuality, I’m instead avoiding specific commentary about the article. I would be shocked if Watson and the Nazi were right in their appraisals of the article though.

If you really need me to type it out for you though, I am not in favour of any sort of ban on heterosexuality.

I don’t particularly like linking to Nazi websites, so if you need to see the Diversity blog piece or Daily Stormer articles, there’s enough information in the video to Google it yourself.

#ComicsGate and the War on Diversity in Comic Books (with special guest Mexie),2019-01-13T02:42:44Z,PT33M16S,112779,5426,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"Face front true believers! In this spine tingling tale of woe, I take on some of comic's most duplicitous ne'er-do--wells! The malicious mob of malcontents known as ComicsGate!

This video was going to be a good 15 minutes longer, but the financial aspect of ComicsGate and the dubious fundraisers involved with it, would probably be more suited to a future video.

For the record, Ai Yazawa’s NANA is in fact the greatest comic of all time. If people don’t believe me, I will make a super long video going into excruciating detail about why this comic about two young women moving to Tokyo is so amazing. We’re still waiting for Yazawa to finish it though. Maybe one day…

Also not included in this video was my opinion that Secret Empire (the one with Nazi Captain America) is the best comic event in years and that Miles Morales should be Spider-Man in all the new movies.

If you haven’t heard of Mexie, she makes great YouTube videos. Definitely check her out. She’s also this channel’s first ever subscriber.

The Persecuted Conservative Con,2018-12-23T01:14:04Z,PT11M11S,72593,3225,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"This is just a quick video about a very common con. I hadn't heard of any of these people, though a few months back one of my viewers left a comment about Christiansen and his dangerous reactionary channel. It was a bit of a struggle find something with enough meat to respond to, but hopefully this will suffice.

As a side note though, one of my biggest pet peeves is having to respond to these ridiculous videos that are completely devoid of any real facts or evidence. I don't know if Christiansen is a ""fact over feels"" type, but you sure don't get that impression from this video.

Empty-Headed Centrism and How It's Weaponized,2018-12-01T22:28:38Z,PT10M54S,124108,6996,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"A video about a certain kind of centrism that trades taking a stance on an issue for a committed to taking a stand in the middle ground.

In case my sarcasm wasn’t enough of a hint, the left/right graphic I made for this video is a gross simplification and shouldn’t be considered a useful tool for depicting a political stance with any detail. It’s being used as a simple backdrop to explain how the Overton Window works. The political opinions of each of the figures aren’t placed perfectly, as I couldn’t quite square Han Solo’s capitalism, but they close enough for the purpose of this video.

As a fun game, see if you can name all the figures along the spectrum. If you’re struggling with the last two on the right, one is from 15th century Spain and the other 9th century France.

And if you’re wondering about that big video I was promising, it’s still coming. It should be the next video. Maybe. I hope…

And it wasn't!

"Why This Channel Exists, Whether I Was Ever a ""Skeptic"", and Other Answers",2018-11-02T16:26:51Z,PT17M19S,38613,1473,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"Apologies for the sound quality for this one. I actually had to record this twice because the first one was a rambling 40 minutes. Most of the answers are off the cuff though, so hopefully I don't make any huge mistakes in here. Aside from admitting my love for a certain rock band.

Time stamps to questions:
0:10 - Why did you decide to make your channel?
1:30 - Who are some my favourite lefty YouTubers?
2:15 - Hi Jose, I would like to ask, were you at one point, like myself, ever convinced by the ""skeptics"" on Youtube? If so, what attracted you to their content? And regardless if you ever were, how did you learn that their content were erroneous and fallacious? Thank you for your content and congratulations on reaching 1k!
5:30 - What's your favorite book and why?
6:30 - Is it antisemitic to ban circumcision?
7:25 - I assume you're from T.O. Are you active in any local political groups and if so how would you recommend people get involved?
8:32 - What are some of your favorite albums?
9:19 - Would you be interested in hosting or participating in livestreams with other YouTube leftists? If so, who are the creators you'd most want to stream with?
10:07 - What do you currently work as, and are you planning to maybe turn your channel into a career some day?
11:48 - What kinda music do you listen to?
13:12 - What do you think the most dangerous reactionary channel on YouTube is?
13:58 - Are you daddy or soyboy?
14:08 - Hablas Español?
14:19 - It would be interesting in your video if you explained your experience with the Canadian social democracy (if this is the right term for your government) for all of us American viewers.

This is the reason given by Theil, but before it was shut down Gawker argued that it was their dogged coverage of Thiel's questionable business dealings that motivated his attack on Gawker. While I think the larger point still stands that a billionaire abusing the legal system to silence a media outlet is a danger, I should have offered Gawker's perspective on the matter as well.

A few sidenotes I should mention:
The 70% figure used in the paper describing where criminals in Chicago get their guns is made up of Family & Friends, but one third of that number includes ""street"" contacts. In other words people the buyer is familiar with, but may not count as a friend or family member. It's still considered a social connection though.

How to Date an Intersectional Feminist,2018-02-14T18:09:31Z,PT14M26S,42933,1914,N/A,José,UCeDKIj0G5XbultKOQnacu_w,"I take a look at some terrible advice/commentary on dating an intersectional feminist from the internet's Roaming Millennial.

Pretending it helps the racists who, yes, are still racist even if they're nice to you. If you pal around with them because they're nice, in spite of the terrible things they say and believe, you might be a part of the problem.
