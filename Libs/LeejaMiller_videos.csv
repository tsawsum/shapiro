Specifically, we'll delve into the conservative reaction to the Barbie movie, plus #tradwives , the ERA, Reagan, and the history of conservative criticism of feminism. Is there a middle ground? Let's discuss!

NOTE: I recognize my discussion of gender in this video is incredibly binary. I want to acknowledge that there is so much more complexity and nuance to this discussion where trans women and gender-nonconforming folks are concerned. For more nuanced discussions on feminism from a trans perspective, see pretty much anything from Contrapoints: https://www.youtube.com/@ContraPoints/videos and Philosophy Tube: https://www.youtube.com/@PhilosophyTube/videos.

Here's a script for when you call them:
""Hi! My name is ________ and I live in _____________. I am a constituent of [insert your Congressperson's name] and I am calling to discuss the Protecting the Right to Organize or PRO Act. That's H.R. 20/S.567. I want to indicate my strong support for the passage of this bill and for an increase in labor organizing protection, and I would like to know their stance on the issue.
[insert back and forth about your Congressperson's stance]
Once again I am strongly in favor of the PRO Act and I urge [insert your Congressperson's name] to vote to pass the act. Thank you.""

Why the US is Still Segregated,2023-05-19T17:00:09Z,PT20M19S,452284,20388,N/A,Leeja Miller,UCb3cDvWiHwRzQaK81PrISbg,"Try 5 pairs of glasses at home for free at http://warbyparker.com/leeja ! | Every single city in the United States is still largely segregated by race. But this isn't just because of coincidence or personal preference. It is because of a systematic, government-sanctioned process over the course of the 20th century that forced Black Americans into low quality, over-crowded housing, and barred them from receiving financing or assistance to buy the few homes that were available to them. We can still see the effects of this state-sanctioned segregation to this day. Let's learn about this in the context of the important Supreme Court decision Shelley v. Kraemer.

The Truth About Adidas' Nazi Roots,2022-10-28T17:00:28Z,PT23M48S,56984,3527,N/A,Leeja Miller,UCb3cDvWiHwRzQaK81PrISbg,"Take back your financial freedom today by visiting http://PDSDebt.com/miller ! Adidas dropped Kanye West and their Yeezy line 19 days after he made pointed antisemitic tweets and laughed about how they would never drop him. This led to #boycottadidas trending on twitter, calls for them to drop the artist, and a resurgence of discussion around the fact that Adidas was founded by literal Nazis. So what's the background on this, is it true, and what larger implications does this discussion have for how we view corporations and their supposed ethics?

How Oscar Wilde Ruined It For Gay Victorians Everywhere,2022-08-24T20:00:17Z,PT18M36S,99706,5779,N/A,Leeja Miller,UCb3cDvWiHwRzQaK81PrISbg,"Go to my sponsor https://aura.com/leeja to try 14 days for free and protect yourself from America's fastest growing crime. Oscar Wilde is considered one of the best literary geniuses to come out of Ireland (sorry I don't think Ireland is part of Great Britain but I honestly have no clue y'all keep fighting about it). However, he was put on trial for being gay. But it wasn't that simple. Oscar Wilde's story challenges us to grapple with whether we should separate the art from the artist. What do you think?

However, this “haunted house” includes actual physical and psychological torture and requires all guests to sign at 40-page waiver that includes a notice that death may result from participating in the experience. Is this even legal??? I wanted to learn more about this horror show so I figured I’d watch a couple of Natalia’s (@NataliaTaylor) videos which seem to be the most popular, and we’ll see the inside story and dissect the 40-page waiver to see if it would actually hold up in court.

Y'all have asked me to explain why Taylor is re-recording all her old albums, which got me down the rabbit hole of Taylor Swift's past legal issues, including the time she sued a guy for $1, the Evermore Theme Park lawsuit, and a self published Amazon book about some guy who sued her for vicarious liability. Let's talk about it!

Short answer: probably. He is claiming authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act which has granted outsized authority to presidents so they can control private foreign assets with very little congressional oversight. Join me on a journey through the decades as I examine this longstanding precedent and whether Trump could use it to ban our beloved TikTok for good.
