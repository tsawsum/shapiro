Text of my new complaint:

The ECU finding titled “We’re being pressured into sex by some trans women, bbc.co.uk Finding by the Head of the Executive Complaints Unit (ECU)” contains a serious oversight.

As explained in the finding, the article originally titled “We’re being pressured into sex by some trans women” received complaints about incorrect pronouns being used when referring to trans women. The ECU addresses these complaints by referring to quotes from a contributor named “Jennie,” who speaks about threats from an unnamed third party referred to as “they.” The ECU conclude that Jennie “said nothing to indicate that the comments in question were made by a trans woman, and the Head of the ECU saw no basis for assuming that they had been. Consequently, he did not accept that this was an instance of misgendering.”

The finding furthermore states that the Head of the ECU “... found no example of misgendering or bioessentialist language in the author’s own words.”

My complaint is that another instance of misgendering that matches these exact criteria is found in the article, in the author’s own words, and has been overlooked by the ECU. This is the relevant passage from the article:

“Another reported a trans woman physically forcing her to have sex after they went on a date.

""[They] threatened to out me as a terf and risk my job if I refused to sleep with [them],"" she wrote. ""I was too young to argue and had been brainwashed by queer theory so [they were] a 'woman' even if every fibre of my being was screaming throughout so I agreed to go home with [them].”

As we can see, the article specifies that the person in question is in fact a trans woman, but then goes on to refer to her as ‘they’ several times in the next paragraph. Additionally, these are the “author’s own words,” as the original text being quoted used ‘he’ and ‘him.’ By the criteria the ECU finding uses to identify misgendering, (using ‘they’ to refer to someone known to be a trans woman) this passage counts as misgendering.",,27,2022,0

Text of my protest complaint:

On Saturday 8th January, a protest was held in front of the BBC’s Broadcasting House in opposition to the BBC’s recent coverage of trans issues. The event was reported on by other news organisations, but received no coverage by the BBC.

The protest was in part a response to an article published on the BBC news website on 26 October 2021 titled 'We're being pressured into sex by some trans women,' which has been widely criticised as biased and transphobic.

In response to accusations of transphobia, the BBC has defended its coverage of trans issues by invoking impartiality, stating that it has a responsibility to make sure a wide range of voices are heard. This claim is dubious, as the BBC is proudly not impartial when it comes to other types of discrimination, but it would be stronger if the BBC did not ignore the protests held in response to its coverage of trans issues.

As things stand, the BBC is giving the impression that its claimed impartiality on this issue is nothing more than an excuse to publish attacks upon trans people.

Text of my escalated complaint:

This response does not answer my initial complaint. It responds as though my complaint was that Chelsea Poe was not included in the article, but this is not the case. My complaint was not that Chelsea Poe was not included. My complaint was that the author of the article both 1) interviewed Chelsea Poe and 2) claims in the article that no high-profile trans women who have spoken about sex and relationships wanted to speak to her. This is not true, because she spoke to Chelsea Poe.

Chelsea Poe is a trans woman. She has spoken about sex and relationships in various media outlets. She was interviewed for the article. This is all beyond dispute. 

Chelsea Poe is also indisputably high profile, by the definition of high profile used by the article. Firstly, she was high profile enough to be contacted and interviewed for the article in the first place. Secondly, the examples given in the article of trans women the author does consider high profile are people who have similar or smaller profiles than Chelsea Poe. It is impossible for those women to be high profile and Chelsea Poe to not be high profile. 

Chelsea Poe has over 20,000 social media followers and has been quoted in Slate, The Huffington Post, Glamour, Paper magazine, and other media outlets. The article includes quotes from people with much smaller profiles than this. 

I understand fully that the author can include or not include whoever she likes in her article and do not need this explained to me. What she cannot do is make false claims about who was interviewed. The article’s claim that no high profile trans women who have spoken about sex and relationships wanted to speak to the author is provably false, and that is what I require a response from the BBC about.

Text of my new complaint:

My complaint is about language used by a source in an article posted on the BBC news website on the 26th October titled 'We're being pressured into sex by some trans women'

The article includes as a source a survey released by the group Get The L Out, which it links to. This survey deliberately and repeatedly refuses to gender trans people correctly. It also approvingly includes a quote which says “All transsexuals rape women’s bodies,” & states in reference to this quote that this “analysis remains as relevant as ever.”

I would like to state that my complaint is solely about the transphobic language present in the survey which is being given a platform by the BBC. I have absolutely no complaints about the sample size, distribution method, or findings of the survey. I have zero issues whatsoever with the survey or the article in which it appears, with the singular exception of the transphobic language and attitudes being shared in the survey. The transphobic language and attitudes are the only thing about which I am complaining, and the only thing for which I require a response.

Does the BBC agree with the attitudes and language expressed in the survey linked in the article? Is it considered acceptable to misgender trans people by the BBC? Are quotes likening all trans people to rapists considered ‘relevant analysis’ by the BBC? Is it acceptable for the BBC to platform such language and attitudes?",,27,2122,0

Text of my complaint:
An article published on the 26th of October titled 'We're being pressured into sex by some trans women'  contains a factual error.

The author, Caroline Lowbridge, states that no 'high profile trans women who have either written or spoken about sex and relationships' wanted to speak to her in order to offer their views on the subject.

This is not true. The author interviewed Chelsea Poe for the article in September 2020. Chelsea Poe is a high-profile trans woman who has spoken extensively about sex and relationships in interviews in Slate, the Huffington Post, Cosmopolitan, Glamour, and other media outlets.

The BBC confirmed to PinkNews that the author interviewed Poe for the piece in an article published on November 4th: https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/11/04/bbc-trans-chelsea-poe-lily-cade/

""A BBC source has confirmed to PinkNews that Lowbridge interviewed Poe, and said that her contribution was judged not to be relevant to the story.""

Given that Lowbridge interviewed Poe and chose not to include her in the article, the claim that no trans women who have written or spoken about sex and relationships wanted to talk to her is factually incorrect.

This inaccuracy must be amended.",,27,6032,0
