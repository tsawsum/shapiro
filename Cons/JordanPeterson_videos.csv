Dr. Scott Tinker is an American geologist, educator, energy expert, and documentary filmmaker. Tinker has appeared in more than 20 documentary films with the intent to communicate scientific ideas to the general public. The 2012 film “Switch” presents a scientifically based look at the global energy transition. It's been screened in over 600 colleges and has gained a following for the Switch Energy Alliance, which brings in young people to learn about the processes of sustainable energy firsthand, while broadening discussion on the matter in an open format setting. Tinkers’ PBS show “Energy Switch” is a point counterpoint talk show that features energy communicators, experts, authors, and pundits.

The Revolution of German Farmers | Eva Vlaardingerbroek & Anthony Lee | EP 416,2024-01-22T22:57:03Z,PT1H42M54S,370734,20773,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Dr. Jordan B. Peterson speaks with German farmer Anthony Lee and journalist Eva Vlaardingerbroek. They discuss the ongoing farmers' protest, the war on efficient agriculture, what is now being panned as the failed German state, the ludicrous net-zero goals creating excess electric vehicles while cutting off the generation of power, and how a grassroots movement can make genuine change at the local and national levels.

Eva Vlaardingerbroek is a Dutch journalist and previous YouTube host of the “Let’s Talk About It” program on the channel Riks. Vlaardingerbroek has published opinion articles in newspapers such as the Dutch weekly Elsevier Weekblad and appeared on programs like Tucker Carlson's show on Fox News. She advocates for a cultural return to faith and a rejection of the WEF manifested, globalist ideology.

Anthony Lee is a German farmer who has become outspoken in recent months as he followed news of farmers struggling all across Europe. Now affecting his home country, the time has come to take a stand, and not just for German farmers and workers, but for everyone.

Worse Than Asbestos? | Dr. Scott McMahon & Dr. Ritchie Shoemaker | EP 415,2024-01-18T22:06:27Z,PT1H47M21S,358251,11050,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Biotoxin.com - information on mold toxicity and what to do about it. 

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson speaks with Dr. Scott McMahon and Dr. Ritchie Shoemaker. They discuss their potentially groundbreaking research into CIRS, or Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome. Backed by research, these two doctors believe that many other illnesses and syndromes such as fibromyalgia, obesity, and even depression might actually be caused by mutations in common mold as a response to our own efforts to live in a hypoallergenic world. 

Scott W. McMahon, MD, founder of Whole World Healthcare has been practicing pediatrics in Roswell, New Mexico, for 26 years. His interest in Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS) began in 2009. Dr. McMahon first learned about CIRS after being approached by a businessman whose daughter became ill while attending a local school. The search for this child’s healing led him to Dr. Richie Shoemaker, the global expert on mold illnesses. McMahon visited Dr. Shoemaker’s practice to learn about the treatment for CIRS and saw the tremendous need for more physicians prepared to treat CIRS. He immediately opened a practice in Roswell specifically to diagnose and treat patients with CIRS, starting with 15 patients from the local school. His CIRS practice has now grown and he has seen thousands of adults and children to date.

Peterson sits down in person with Dr. John Vervaeke. They discuss the relationship between your calling and your conscience, the three dimensions of the sacred, how Descartes' famous “I think therefore I am” conclusion might be restructured in modern day, what exactly Socrates’s Daemon was, and the bridging of morality and meaning.

John Vervaeke is an Associate Professor in Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Science at the University of Toronto. His work constructs a bridge between science and spirituality in order to understand the experience of meaningfulness and the cultivation of wisdom so as to afford awakening from the meaning crisis.

They explore his upbringing within the “church,” how Scientology entices new members, the basis for Dianetics in Freudian psychology, the religiously inspired twist only found behind multiple paywalls, the higher being known as Xenu, what broke Aaron’s belief, and his now ongoing fight against the manipulation of this still relevant, international cult.

Aaron Smith-Levin is a former Scientologist and host of the “Growing Up In Scientology” YouTube channel. He was also a main interviewee on the docu-series “Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath.” Since leaving the cult, he has devoted himself and his career to unmasking the harmful practices and beliefs held by the international religion.

True Stories from a Soviet Spy | Jack Barsky | EP 412,2024-01-08T22:00:13Z,PT1H42M4S,250185,8733,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Dr. Jordan B. Peterson speaks with ex-KGB spy, author, and podcaster, Jack Barsky. They discuss Jack's upbringing under the communist utopian dream, following the motivating sentiment of “freedom for the oppressed,” how he embedded himself in American society, what brought him into contact with the FBI, and how he was able to walk away.

Jack Barsky (born Albrecht Dittrich, Jack being at first an American alias) is a German-American author, IT specialist and former sleeper agent of the KGB. He spied on the United States from 1978 to 1988, and was exposed after the Cold War. Barsky then became a resource for U.S. counterintelligence agencies, which secured his citizenship. His autobiography, “Deep Undercover,” was published in 2017.

Peterson speaks with English actor, musician, broadcaster, and party leader Laurence Fox. They discuss his current canceling, arrest, and litigation, the globalist scheming of London's current mayor, Sadiq Khan, the ironic expansion of surveillance cameras across England, and the state of Western Democracy when removed from humor, art, and nuance.

Laurence Fox graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 2001. He debuted as a screen actor in 2001’s The Hole, directed by Nick Hamm. He is likely best known in the entertainment world for his 10 year stint as James Hathaway in the TV show Lewis. In 2020, Fox criticized both the George Floyd riots, and the COVID vaccine mandates, coming from the Conservative point of view. He then founded the Reclaim Party, from which he unsuccessfully ran for mayor. Since this, he has been ever-present in the media, denouncing political correctness.

Jordan Peterson & Sam Harris Try to Find Something They Agree On | EP 408,2023-12-25T22:00:00Z,PT2H8M33S,712175,16481,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with author, philosopher, and app developer Sam Harris. They discuss the benefits of routine meditation, deleting X (Twitter), the issue of defining a Higher Good, the reality of evil, and the difficulty in establishing a shared morality. 

Sam Harris is the author of five New York Times best sellers. His books include The End of Faith, Letter to a Christian Nation, The Moral Landscape, Free Will, Lying, Waking Up, and Islam and the Future of Tolerance (with Maajid Nawaz). The End of Faith won the 2005 PEN Award for Nonfiction. His writing and public lectures cover a wide range of topics—neuroscience, moral philosophy, religion, meditation practice, human violence, rationality—but generally focus on how a growing understanding of ourselves and the world is changing our sense of how we should live.

Dr. Peterson Interviews Former U.S. Most Wanted Cybercriminal | Brett Johnson | EP 406,2023-12-18T22:21:19Z,PT2H13M33S,511810,11889,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down in-person with Brett Johnson, formerly the United States’ most wanted cyber criminal, now a public speaker and expert on cyber security. They discuss the nurturing of a child into a criminal, the compartmentalization of guilt, the psychology of exploitation, the creation of the precursor to the dark web, and what caused Johnson to walk away completely.

Brett Johnson. Former U.S. Most Wanted Cybercriminal. Now Good Guy. The United States Secret Service called Mr. Johnson ""The Original Internet Godfather"" for his role in refining modern financial cybercrime. Or to put it another way: Brett was convicted of 39 felonies, placed on the U.S. Most Wanted List, escaped from prison, and … he built the first organized cybercrime community, Shadowcrew. Shadowcrew was a precursor to today's darknet and darknet markets, and it laid the foundation for the way modern cybercrime channels operate today. Johnson was sentenced to 90 months in Federal Prison. End of story? Not hardly. Brett found redemption through his sister, his wife Michele, and finally the FBI. He was given the chance to turn his life around. He took it. Today, Brett is considered one of the leading authorities on cybercrime, identity theft, and cybersecurity on the planet. He works hard to protect businesses and consumers from the type of person he used to be.

The Demons of Childhood Trauma | Aaron Stark | EP 405,2023-12-14T22:03:56Z,PT1H42M46S,418227,15821,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with public speaker and mental health advocate Aaron Stark. You might recognize Aaron's name from his deeply impactful TED Talk, “I was almost a school shooter.” They walk through his life story and discuss the all-too-real result of deep parental trauma, the psychology of abuse that shapes self loathing and self harm, the drivers that nearly pushed Aaron from victim into monster, and the real, tangible act of kindness that saved lives.

Aaron Stark was almost a school shooter. As a dark and destructive teen, Stark almost committed a terrible attack. Today he is a happy father of four, and he wants to do all he can to help anyone on that path to find a way into the light again and to see that they matter.

After watching the news coverage of the Parkland school shootings, Stark wrote an open letter, “I was almost a school shooter.” This was sent to local news 9KUSA in Denver and was the feature story on “Next with Kyle Clark.” This story gained national attention and over 17 million views in a very short time, which propelled him into a life of activism for mental wellness awareness. He has been featured on ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC and has published an article in the Washington Post. These features were followed by his viral TEDx talk, “I Was Almost a School Shooter” that currently has over 14 million views and is shown in schools, colleges, and universities, all the way up to the Dept. of Education.

A Psychologist and Historian Discuss the End of the World | Dr. Niall Ferguson | EP 404,2023-12-11T22:00:12Z,PT1H6M52S,475501,13202,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with historian and author Niall Ferguson. They discuss the historical and deeply mythological precedent of world-ending narratives, how the global doomsday ethos abdicates local responsibility while empowering the elite class, the out-of-control gigantism plaguing our administrative states today, and how we might strive to deal with genuine tragedy morally, religiously, and with humility.

Niall Ferguson is a Scottish-American historian, author, columnist, TV presenter, and academic. He is the Milbank Family Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution of Stanford University, as well as a senior fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University. Ferguson has written many books, such as “Empire: How Britain Made the Modern World,” “Colossus: The Rise and Fall of the American Empire,” “The Square and the Tower,” and most recently, “Doom: The Politics of Catastrophe,” which has been shortlisted for the Lionel Gelber prize.

The Ron DeSantis You've Never Met | Presidential Candidate and Florida Governor | EP 402,2023-12-04T22:00:08Z,PT1H2M34S,278202,11638,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with the 46th governor of Florida and 2024 presidential candidate Ron DeSantis. They discuss his working-class upbringing, the fundamentals of team building, the drastic need for government reduction, and how Florida might work as a national blueprint post 2024.

Ron DeSantis is an American politician in the Republican party. He is a veteran from the U.S. Navy and is currently serving as the 46th governor of Florida (since 2019). DeSantis was initially a member of Congress elected in 2012, 2014, and 2016. He was a founding member of the Freedom Caucus, a Right-wing congressional caucus formed by conservatives and Tea Party members alike. DeSantis was an avid supporter of Donald Trump during his first campaign and is now running squarely against him for the 2024 presidential elections.

Rife For Cancellation | Matt Rife | EP 401,2023-11-30T22:00:12Z,PT1H13M50S,4218252,114856,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down in-person with recently “canceled” comedian Matt Rife. They discuss the incident in question, his viral response, the prominence of crowd work in his act, his early career start at the age of 15, the innovative use of social media to build his name, and the real reason he remains unapologetic for having a sense of humor.

Matthew Steven Rife was born in 1995 and is an American stand up comedian and actor. He started early, entering a school talent show at the age of 14 after being encouraged by a friend. Finding this to be a success, he went professional the next year at age 15. Using TikTok, he managed to consistently go viral with his stand up and ""red flag"" crowd work. He then entered the arena full time, using social media to grow his name before producing three straight-to-YouTube comedy specials from 2021 to 2023. This year, he debuted his first Netflix special, ""Natural Selection.""

Creeping Tyranny In Canada — And The West | Josh & Nick Alexander | EP 399,2023-11-23T22:12:16Z,PT1H46M34S,410897,14715,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with Save Canada organizers Josh and Nick Alexander. They discuss the resurgence of activism for christian ideals and family values, the abhorrent response from administrative bodies, mainstream media, and law enforcement, the threats and physical violence levied against their family and organization, and what their battle really means for Canada and the world at large.

Josh Alexander is a 17-year-old Christian student activist. Josh has been denied an education at the Renfrew County Catholic District School Board since November 2022, after speaking out against the radical left-wing gender ideology in schools. After three arrests since February, one having been at his high school, Josh has continued to publicly uphold his convictions in the face of the rapidly developing censorious state.

Nick Alexander is the older brother of Josh Alexander. He has been arrested 3 times and removed from his fire department for exercising his rights to oppose the mainstream narrative. Nick recently made headlines after being assaulted with an edged weapon by union supported counter protestors and then arrested.

Together Josh and Nick lead the Save Canada movement as it sweeps the country bringing the message of truth to our youth and providing a rallying point for concerned citizens.

Dr. Kevin Roberts is the current and 7th president of the Heritage Foundation (granted the role in 2021), an American Conservative think tank tackling issues on border control, immigration, inflation, among many other policy driven topics. He received his PhD in History from the University of Texas. After this, he taught history for a number of years.

He was president for 7 years before resigning in order to become president of the Wyoming Catholic College.

Progressing Through Difficult Conversation | Congressman Adam Smith | EP 395,2023-11-09T22:00:10Z,PT1H55M18S,125434,3597,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with lawyer, state representative, and author Adam Smith. They discuss his new book “Lost and Broken: My Journey Back from Chronic Pain and Crippling Anxiety.” From this they explore the differences between cognitive and behavioral therapy, the dogmatization of nuance, the rise of “harm reduction” in the current era of identity politics, and the ideal goal of argument: it’s much more than just scoring points.

Congressman Adam Smith is an American lawyer and politician, having served in the Washington state senate from 1991 to 97. His new book, “Lost and Broken: My Journey Back from Chronic Pain and Crippling Anxiety,”  has just recently been released.

One Of The Deepest Conversations You Will Listen To About God | Dr. John Lennox | EP 394,2023-11-06T22:41:17Z,PT1H28M58S,875839,28850,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with mathematician, author, and theologian Dr. John Lennox. They discuss the axioms and dangerous aims of transhumanism, the interplay between ethical faith, reason, and the empirical world that makes up the scientific endeavor, and the line between luciferian intellectual presumption and wise courageous exploration.

Dr. John Carson Lennox is a ​​Northern Irish mathematician, bioethicist, and Christian apologist. He has written several books, and was a professor at Oxford and Green Templeton College (Now retired) where he specialized in group theory. Lennox appeared in numerous debates with questions ranging from “Is God Good” to “Is There a God,” and faced off with academic titans such as Richard Dawkins, Michael Shermer, and Christopher Hitchens, among others. Lennox speaks four languages – English, German, French, and Russian, has written 70 peer-reviewed articles on mathematics, co-authored two Oxford Mathematical Monographs, and was noted for his role in translating Russian mathematics while working as a professor.

The Makings of a Leader | The Honourable Tony Abbott | EP 393,2023-11-02T21:01:12Z,PT1H40M14S,235833,7245,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with Australian journalist and former prime minister, the Honourable Tony Abbott. They discuss Australia’s role on the world stage, the problems facing their economy and culture, how the quasi-cult of carbon threatens the developing world, why new religions propagate where faith has been abdicated, and the looming threat of war as China destabilizes while Putin pushes forward against Ukraine.

Tony Abbott was elected prime minister by the Australian people on September 7, 2013, and served for two years. In that time, the carbon tax and mining tax were repealed, free trade agreements were finalized with China, Japan and Korea; the people smuggling trade from Indonesia to Australia were halted, and Australia became the second largest military contributor to the US-led campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq. Currently, he is a director of the Ramsay Centre for Western Civilization, serves on the council of the Australian War Memorial, and is an adviser to the UK Board of Trade. He’s patron to several charities, including Soldier On, the International Sports Promotion Society, and Worldwide Support for Development.

The Postmodernist Drinking Song,2023-10-31T19:19:49Z,PT4M54S,918684,53589,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"In the face of Postmodernist intellectual stupidity, the best thing to do is laugh. Hence The Postmodernist Drinking Song. 

The Postmodernist Drinking Song is based on an old English folk song, The Ballad of Lydia Pinkham, by way of a 1960’s British pop group, the Scaffold, whose variant Lily the Pink reached number one in the UK singles chart in ’68 ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x8D4T--0v4 ). Our version was partly inspired, as well, by the brilliant idiocy of Monty Python’s The Philosophers Song, which celebrated the drunken shenanigans of the greatest thinkers of the Western tradition ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9SqQNgDrgg ).

Postmodernism is a school of thought, increasingly dominant in what still passes for the modern academy, that famously rejects “grand narratives”—“collective myths that never had a reality,” as certain philosophers have it ( https://shorturl.at/fMO46 ). Equally famously, however, the same thinkers turned, post-rejection, to the murderous blandishments of the Marxist story, which was in turn based on an even longer tradition of Luciferian arrogance and bitter resentment. No grand narrative--except, of course, that of power (with a nice dollop of immature hedonism tossed in, just to sweeten the pot). 
   
Our Cast (in order of appearance): 
Jordan B Peterson thoroughly-masked resentful Taco delivery boy and heroic Antifa activist
Random far-right cat (well-petted)
Unknown green-haired narcissist
Unknown trucker convoy participant
Michel Foucault puppet of Satan himself
Various victim-children puppets
Mikhaila Peterson enemy to vegans and far-right daughter
Commie pig
Dave Rubin far-right comedian
Douglas Murray far-right journalist and piano prodigy
Jacques Derrida that old joker puppet
Zuby far-right rapper and women’s powerlifting record holder
Jonathan Pageau far-right Old Testament prophet and Frenchman
Michael Malice whatever the hell he is
Konstantin Kisin far-right dangerous Russian
Unknown blue-haired beautiful woman
Ben Shapiro squeaking horribly
Gad Saad reprehensible far-right purple-haired professor provocateur and evil Jew
Robin DiAngelo puppet and demented-denizens-of-the-corporate-world charmer

Peterson sits down with author and journalist Matt Taibbi. They discuss his early career both in journalism and professional basketball, his time in the U.S.S.R. learning Russian and publishing a successful gonzo-inspired newspaper, and his breaking coverage of the subprime mortgage bubble. They also examine the state of the world today with Russia and the U.S. military industrial complex, the upcoming presidential election, and the dire necessity for alternative news sources.

Matt Taibbi is an award-winning investigative reporter and one of America’s more recognizable literary voices.  In 2002, Taibbi began work as a contributing editor for Rolling Stone. There he won the National Magazine Award for commentary. He is best known for his coverage of four presidential campaigns, of the 2008 financial crisis, and the criminal justice system. He has written ten books, including four New York Times bestsellers: The Great Derangement, Griftopia, The Divide, and Insane Clown President. His book, I Can’t Breathe, about the police killing of Eric Garner, was named one of the year’s ten best books by the Washington Post. His latest book about media division, Hate Inc., has been hailed by everyone from Joe Rogan to Publishers Weekly, and called “The best explanation of media behavior since Manufacturing Consent” by Glenn Greenwald.

The Prison Inside  | Glenn Greenwald | EP 391,2023-10-26T21:00:20Z,PT1H47M7S,239301,7827,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Dr. Jordan B. Peterson sits down with author, journalist, and political commentator Glenn Greenwald. They discuss the war on information: how social moralism, religious rhetoric, conceptual safety, and false compassion have been used and propagandized to reshape the western world into a good versus bad, red versus blue polarity. They also explore the human need for meta narratives, the basis of morality, and the case for God in a world that offers nihilism.

​​Glenn Greenwald is a journalist, author, and former constitutional law attorney. His original hit blog was a springboard into writing for Salon and the Guardian with a focus on national security issues. In 2013, he published the now iconic Snowden documents detailing global government surveillance by the U.S. and British governments. In 2019 Greenwald again broke leaked documents, this time for “Operation Car Wash,” which shone a spotlight on the corruption of the Brazilian judicial system. He would later detail his work in a series of books such as Securing Democracy: My Fight for Press Freedom and Justice in Brazil and No Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the NSA, and the U.S. Surveillance State.

Of Baboons and Men | Robert Sapolsky | EP 390,2023-10-23T20:00:01Z,PT1H45M37S,574632,15081,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Dr. Jordan B Peterson sits down with Neuroendocrinology researcher and author of the upcoming book Determined: A Science of Life Without Free Will, Robert Sapolsky. They discuss how Game Theory applies to human behavior across iterative rounds of play, the unexpected success of the tit-for-tat principle, the role of dopamine in the anticipation of the future, and the objective reality of transcendent structures within our biological routines.

Robert Sapolsky is an American Neuroendocrinology researcher, author, and communicator. He has spent decades studying primates in the wild, written numerous articles and books, as well as produced multiple video series on the subject. By the age of 12, Sapolsky was writing to well known primatologists as a fan, and had also begun teaching himself Swahili with the early ambition of heading to Tanzanian, Mozambique, and Kenya in search of his own primates (Specifically Silverback Gorillas) to study. Not too much later, Sapolsky would make contact with a group of gorillas in Kenya, a group he would visit every year for 25 years, spending 4 months studying them at a time.  Sapolsky would go on to become the John A. and Cynthia Fry Gunn Professor at Stanford University, holding joint appointments in several departments, including Biological Sciences, Neurology & Neurological Sciences, and Neurosurgery.

Cancelled Yet? | Greg Lukianoff and Rikki Schlott | EP 388,2023-10-16T21:00:09Z,PT1H44M35S,267982,8898,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Dr. Jordan B Peterson sits down with Greg Lukianoff and Rikki Schlott to discuss the inception of their new book, “The Canceling of the American Mind,” which seeks to assess cancel culture as it harshly affects American universities and institutions. They also break down the differences between feminine and masculine tendencies in regards to free speech, the entirely real and yet rarely discussed toxic femininity, and why we must prioritize a cultural shift away from the ease of victimhood.

Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8

Greg Lukianoff is a journalist, producer, attorney, New York Times bestselling author, and the president and CEO of FIRE (Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression), which is the nation's leading defender of fundamental rights on college campuses. In 2022, FIRE announced they would expand their coverage to fundamental rights off-campus as well, and at this time added “Expression” to their name and mission statement.

Rikki Schlott is a New York City-based journalist and political commentator. She is a former research fellow at FIRE, host of the Lost Debate podcast, a columnist at the New York Post, and a regular contributor to numerous publications and television programs. Her commentary focuses on free speech, campus culture, civil liberties, and youth issues from a Generation Z perspective.

Is Reality an Illusion? | Dr. Donald Hoffman | EP 387,2023-10-12T21:00:13Z,PT1H35M21S,348003,10272,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Dr. Jordan B Peterson and cognitive neuroscientist Dr. Donald Hoffman discuss what we know as reality, why space time is now being considered a “doomed” framework, and how consciousness can be understood as a vast probability space within which we orient ourselves.

Hoffman received a Bachelor of Arts degree in quantitative psychology from the University of California at Los Angeles, and then his Doctorate of Philosophy in computational psychology at MIT. He briefly worked as a research scientist at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab, before taking on the role of assistant professor at the University of California at Irvine. He is now a professor in the department of Cognitive Sciences. He has written four books (below), on the topics of human vision, perception, consciousness, and the effects of/reasons for evolution on each. He is also a key proponent of MUI (Multimodal User Interface) theory, which states that ""perceptual experiences do not match or approximate properties of the objective world, but instead provide a simplified, species-specific, user interface to that world."" Hoffman argues that conscious beings have not evolved to perceive the world as it actually is but have evolved to perceive the world in a way that maximizes ""fitness payoffs.”

Stranger Than Fiction | Willie & Korie Robertson | EP 385,2023-09-28T21:00:06Z,PT1H57M46S,237022,6873,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Dr. Jordan B Peterson and stars of “Duck Dynasty,” Willie and Korie Robertson, discuss faith and family values as they were presented in the show, how they were preserved behind-the-scenes, the balance between reality and fiction, structure and playful spontaneity that was captured on “Duck Dynasty,” and the true positive impact the show had on viewers, as well as the culture of America during and since its phenomenal 11-season run.

Willie and Korie Robertson are the stars of A&E’s hit reality TV show “Duck Dynasty” and executive producers of “The Blind,” the true story of the Robertson family. Together, they grew their family business, Duck Commander, from a living room operation into a destination for all things outdoors. They also built Tread Lively, a multimedia production company that creates films, television shows, and award-winning podcasts that uplift the culture. 

The Robertsons' story is a remarkable example of entrepreneurship built on faith, family, and ducks, in that order. Married for 31 years, they live in West Monroe, Louisiana, with their large and growing family. Their writing credits include “The Duck Commander Family: How Faith, Family, and Ducks Built a Dynasty,” “American Hunter,” “American Entrepreneur,” and “Strong and Kind: Raising Kids of Character.” Willie and Korie are passionate about adoption, storytelling, and doing life with their kids and grand-babies. They are currently developing several exciting film, podcasting, and TV projects.

Ending Affirmative Action | Dr. Peter Arcidiacono | EP 384,2023-09-21T21:00:20Z,PT1H37M15S,196560,5398,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Ep. 384

Dr. Jordan B Peterson and econometrician Peter Arcidiacono discuss the recent landmark decision by the Supreme Court to end Affirmative Action, how his research was instrumental in that outcome, why merit is repeatedly proven to be the best indicator of success, how compassion is used to cloak racial discrimination, and what might actually yield results in service to the under-resourced communities across the United States.

Peter Arcidiacono is the William Henry Glasson Professor of Economics at Duke University. He received his PhD from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1999 and has taught at Duke University ever since. He is a fellow of the Econometric Society and the International Association of Applied Econometricians. He is best known for his work in three areas: college major choice, affirmative action in higher education, and structural estimation of dynamic discrete choice models. He served as an expert witness for the plaintiffs in the Supreme Court cases SFFA v. Harvard and SFFA v. UNC, examining the role race played in the admissions process at both institutions.

Striking the Chord of an Entire Country | Oliver Anthony | EP 382,2023-09-07T22:55:13Z,PT1H52M46S,2192638,76445,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Ep. 382

Dr. Jordan B Peterson and breakout musician Chris Lunsford, better known by his stage name Oliver Anthony, discuss the balance between vision and efficiency in artistic and commercial endeavors, why Chris’ hit song “Rich Men North of Richmond,” has resonated so broadly and so quickly, the way honest expression through music can combat demoralization, how politics have become confused with the sacred, and what we can do to restore each to their proper order.

Oliver Anthony, real name Christopher Anthony Lunsford, is an American country/folk musician from Farmville, Virginia. He just recently went viral for his anthem song, “Rich Men North of Richmond” – which has resonated across the country for its messaging about Washington D.C. and the state of poverty and mental health in the broader U.S.. Chris has stated his politics as being right down or near the center, though already tribalism has attempted to take hold of or alternatively reduce/dismiss him, all the while “Rich Men” has amassed nearly 60 million views on YT in just over a month, and trended the billboard charts (Hitting number one more than once) since its release. Chris named his YT channel Oliver Anthony Music after his grandfather, whom he has described as a “real 1930’s Appalachian man.” Since his song's virality, he has already been offered – and turned down – an 8 million dollar recording contract, and is making waves as a truly authentic artist both in performance and practice.

"Mindset, Health, And Life | Dr. Ellen Langer | EP 381",2023-08-31T15:10:18Z,PT1H57M41S,401968,11965,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Ep. 381

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and “The mother of mindfulness,” Dr. Ellen Langer discuss her latest book, The Mindful Body: Thinking Our Way To Chronic Health. From this they explore how intentioned awareness paired with humility allows for a healthier mindset and body, how the perception of time impacts the effects of disease and age, the way to view tragedy and suffering so that we may conquer it through faith and hope, and the immense benefits found in carefully considering to what, where, and who you direct your attention.

Ellen J. Langer was the first woman to be tenured in psychology at Harvard, where she is still professor of psychology. The recipient of three Distinguished Scientists awards, the Arthur W. Staats Award for Unifying Psychology, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and the Liberty Science Genius Award, Dr. Langer is the author of eleven other books, including the international bestseller Mindfulness, as well as The Power of Mindful Learning, Counterclockwise and On Becoming an Artist. Her trailblazing experiments in social psychology have earned her inclusion in The New York Times Magazine’s “Year in Ideas” issue. She is known worldwide as the “mother of mindfulness” and the “mother of positive psychology”. She lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Vision Restored | Vivek Ramaswamy | EP 380,2023-08-17T15:00:47Z,PT1H44M13S,1007890,38402,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Ep. 380

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and 2024 presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy discuss his ongoing campaign, the long-growing hunger for depth in political discussion, the dire need for a renewed American vision, and how Vivek plans to strip the Washington administrative agencies of their unconstitutional powers.

Vivek Ramaswamy is an entrepreneur, author, and political activist. Vivek has been making headlines since announcing his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election, running on a platform in part to dismantle the expansive and corrupt bureaucracy that has seeped into nearly all facets of American government. Prior to this, Ramaswamy was the founder and CEO of the biopharmaceutical company Roivant Sciences. Leaving in 2021, he published “Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam.” In 2022, he co-founded Strive Asset Management with Anson Frericks, which focuses on an alternative to the now-pushed ESG investment framework. That same year Ramaswamy published “Nation of Victims: Identity Politics, the Death of Merit, and the Path Back to Excellence.” and has since been deemed one of the “Intellectual Godfathers of the anti-woke movement.”

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Helen Joyce discuss the takedown of their last interview on this channel, the true tradition of women’s rights, and the harsh reality of what women stand to lose today.

Helen Joyce is an Irish novelist and journalist, acting as the executive editor for events and business at the Economist in London. Before this, she trained as a mathematician, graduating from the Trinity College in Dublin, before attending Cambridge. She then acquired a PhD in geometric measure theory at the University College London. She has held many roles as a journalist, working for PLUS Magazine and Significance Magazine, both of which have an emphasis on communicating complex math and statistics to the everyday reader. Later, she would spend three years as the Economist’s foreign correspondent to Brazil, living in São Paulo. In 2018, Joyce curated a series of articles on transgender identity, which led her to author the Sunday Times bestselling book, “Trans: When Ideology Meets Reality.”

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Kellie-Jay Keen, AKA Posie Parker, discuss her rude awakening as a women’s rights activist, the irony of arguing for women’s rights against transgender “women,” the censorship now abundant across leading streaming platforms, and why those speaking out continue to do so against all odds.

Kellie-Jay Keen is a women’s rights activist and founder of the group “Standing For Women.” Her group events, #LetWomenSpeak, became so popular in the UK that Keen launched a world tour which has greatly influenced international discourse on the transgender movement and the importance of preserving women’s spaces and affordances.

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Douglas Murray, author of “The War on The West,” discuss how a misguided purpose leads to abject misery, the cowardice of experts who choose silence in the face of malevolence, the psychology of fear, and the necessity of willful exposure to combat it.

He is the founder of the think tank the Centre for Social Cohesion, which is now part of the Henry Jackson Society. His publications include but are not limited to:  “The Strange Death of Europe: Immigration, Identity, Islam (2017),” “The Madness of Crowds: Gender, Race and Identity (2019),” and most recently “The War on the West: How to Prevail in the Age of Unreason (2022)”. Murray has also written columns for publications such as “The Wall Street Journal” and is an associate editor for “The Spectator.”

Tyrant Contra God | Biblical Series: Exodus Episode 1,2023-07-17T15:37:21Z,PT2H19M24S,2821251,91568,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Exodus first debuted on November 25, 2022 on DailyWire+. Its contents were so impactful and widely needed that the DW+ executive team and Dr. Peterson decided to make the series available for free on YouTube for a limited time. The series has since been returned to its permanent home on the DailyWire+ platform. You can view episode 1 for free on YouTube. The remainder of the series can be viewed exclusively on DailyWire+. Thank you for joining us as we journey through the Great Book of Exodus. 

In episode one, Jordan and his roundtable explore the themes of freedom against tyranny, God’s allowance of evil, and faith as an adventure within the first three chapters of Exodus. They seek to answer the question of whether one should take the easy path even if it is wrong or do what is right despite it being hard.

Thank you very much to all the participants: Dr. Os Guiness, Dr. Douglas Hedley, Dr. James Orr, Dr. Larry Arnn, Gregg Hurwitz, Ben Shapiro, Dr. Dennis Prager, Dr. Stephen Blackwood, Jonathan Pageau, and Dr. Jordan B. Peterson.

And thank you very much to the DailyWire+ crew for having the vision and generosity of spirit to make this Exodus seminar freely available to all who are interested. Perhaps you might consider a DailyWire+ subscription; it's a bastion of free speech. We have great content there with much more to come. Click here to learn more: https://bit.ly/3Q0lXj7

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Eric Edmeades discuss his early experiences with homelessness, the extent and detriment of alcoholism, the changes you can make to restructure your physiological responses, the relationship between trust and sales, and the world of possibility that opens when you embrace the unknown, the potentially dangerous, and above all that which calls to you. 

Eric Edmeades, a globally recognized keynote speaker, prolific entrepreneur, and recognized authority in health, practical psychology, and behavioral transformation, has made significant strides in the health and wellness industry. His revolutionary program, WILDFIT®, has positively transformed the lives of over a hundred thousand individuals across more than 130 countries, underscoring his innovative and impactful approach to health. Edmeades is in the process of releasing his forthcoming book, ""The Evolution Gap: A Survival Guide for Modern Civilization"". This enlightening work explores the growing disconnect between our slow-moving biological evolution and our remarkable ability to innovate at a breakneck pace. Edmeades suggests that this gap is the root cause of much of today's pain, suffering, and disease, and he provides practical strategies to bridge this divide and enhance our collective wellbeing.

The Humorless Fundamentalists of Social Justice | Andrew Doyle | EP 373,2023-07-06T15:00:15Z,PT1H46M53S,527976,13582,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Ep. 373

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Andrew Doyle discuss the intentional irrationality of far-left doctrines using religious rhetoric despite the absence of God, their paramount desire to dismantle societal structures, regardless of need or merit, the argument for transcendence inherent in the pursuit of art, and how woke culture stifles genuine expression, forcing dogma in the place of fundamental truths. 

Andrew Doyle is a writer, broadcaster and comedian.  His latest book is The New Puritans: How the Religion of Social Justice Captured the Western World.  He is also the author of Free Speech and Why It Matters, and has written two books under the name of his satirical character Titania McGrath – Woke: A Guide to Social Justice and My First Little Book of Intersectional Activism.

The Fight Against Worldwide Child Slavery & the Sex Trade | Jim Caviezel and Tim Ballard | EP 372,2023-07-03T15:00:40Z,PT1H36M27S,6225603,313678,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Ep. 372

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson discusses the new film “Sound of Freedom,” with star Jim Caviezel and real life inspiration Tim Ballard. The film details Ballard’s work as a Special Agent to fight against sex trafficking and the child sex trade. They go into depth on the psychology of pedophilia, the nature of good and evil, and how a steady faith in God has guided all three.

Tim Ballard is the founder and CEO of Operation Underground Railroad (O.U.R.), which locates and rescues endangered children victimized by sex trafficking rings.  Previously, he accrued a decade of experience as a Special Agent in the Dept. of Homeland Security, working as an undercover op for the U.S. Child Sex Tourism Jump Team.

Jim Caviezel is a prominent American actor and household name in no small part for his portrayal of Jesus Christ in “The Passion of the Christ,” (sequel coming in 2024). He has had a decades long career both on and off screen, and is an advocate for faith in the modern world.

Listen and Weep | Eric Metaxas | EP 371,2023-06-29T18:32:00Z,PT1H33M15S,1132412,31554,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Ep. 371

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Eric Metaxas discuss his most recent book, “A Letter to the American Church,” which argues a betrayal of faith by those who stay silent in the face of tyranny. They parallel the arbiters of speech across history against those populating today, and detail the responsibility to act against falsehood that is intrinsically present in the Abrahamic tradition, yet increasingly absent in the American church today.

Eric Metaxas is an American author, speaker, and radio host. He has written award winning biographies, such as “Bonhoeffer,” as well as children's books like “Squanto and the Miracle of Thanksgiving,” Metaxas hosts Socrates in the City,  a recurring popular event where he interviews writers and thinkers on theology, moralism, and philosophy. He also hosts the nationally syndicated Eric Metaxas Show, more broadly referred to as “The Show About Everything.”

School-Kids as Factory Products | Zach Lahn | EP  370,2023-06-26T15:00:08Z,PT1H42M3S,578829,14060,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Ep. 370

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Zach Lahn discuss the Wonder School, a Socratic-based education system in Wichita, Kansas. They delve into the value of learner-driven education, the origins of the American school system as a means to create obedient factory workers, and the true role of schools in shaping a child’s character. They also walk through a day in the life of a Wonder Leaner, the curriculum designed to help inspire these students toward their true calling, and exactly why this unconventional approach might be well worth your consideration as a parent.

Zach Lahn is the co-founder of Wonder, a learner-driven school in Wichita, Kansas, with the mission of helping young people find their calling and preparing them to change the world. His background in business has been as a founder of a search fund focused on acquiring and building small to medium companies. Prior to founding Wonder, Zach managed U.S. Congressional and Senatorial campaigns and raised funds for startup companies and nonprofit organizations. He now spends nearly all of his time at school with his six kids and with his wife, building a regenerative farm on his family’s ancestral homestead in Iowa.

Leadership and the Trucker Convoy | Tamara Lich and Tammy Peterson | EP 369,2023-06-22T22:40:32Z,PT1H48M38S,818168,28814,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Ep. 369

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson, Tammy Peterson, and Tamara Lich break down the events leading up to, during, and after the internationally recognized Canadian Freedom Convoy, which sought to publicize and end ridiculous COVID mandates as they heavily affected the multi-national trucking industry. Lich was a key organizer and has suffered for her role, spending a total of 48 days in jail over “mischief,” while being labeled a terrorist and being legally barred from using social media. 

Tamara Lich is a Canadian activist with a background organizing the 2018-2019 Yellow Vest protests in Alberta. She was also an early founder of the secession movement in western Canada known as WEXIT. Lich also had a prior career in the logistics field regarding Canadian energy and first became vocal about the unrivaled efficiency of her country’s fossil fuel industry, despite the mainstream media claiming otherwise.

Speak Softly and Carry a Big Stick | Mike Pence | EP 368,2023-06-19T15:00:41Z,PT1H4M10S,472651,11997,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Ep. 368

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and former Vice President Mike Pence discuss his current run for the 2024 presidency, the U.S. Government's overreach in economic matters when it should be playing referee, the indoctrination and sexualization of our youngest citizens, the realistic way forward on the Russia Ukraine front, and how we might finally stabilize a nation wrought with cultural warfare. 

Mike Pence, an American politician and native Hoosier, served as the 48th vice president of the United States from 2017 to 2021. He previously served as the 50th governor of Indiana from 2013 to 2017, and a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 2001 to 2013. Before this he practiced private law, led the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, and hosted “The Mike Pence Show,” a syndicated talk radio show that also aired as a public affairs program on TV once a week. He only recently announced his candidacy for President of the United States, and is currently on the campaign trail.

You are the Target | James Lindsay | EP 367,2023-06-15T15:00:32Z,PT1H50M40S,976509,31206,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Ep. 367

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Dr. James Lindsay break down how Marxism evolved from a singular ideology into a genus, spawning many oppressor/oppressed dogmas across modern culture such as equity, critical race theory, and queer theory. They trace these sub-Marxist doctrines back past fundamental narrative into the theological realm, and detail their utility in the acquisition of power. Dr. Peterson and Dr. Lindsay also discuss the Grievance Studies Affair, of which Dr. Lindsay was a co-author and which casts a spotlight on the Marxist capture of our academic and scientific institutions.

An author, mathematician, and political commentator, Dr. James Lindsay has written eight books spanning a range of subjects including education, postmodern theory, and critical race theory. Dr. Lindsay is the founder of New Discourses, an organization dedicated to shining the light of objective truth in subjective darkness. Dr. Lindsay is the co-author of “Cynical Theories: How Activist Scholarship Made Everything about Race, Gender, and Identity―and Why This Harms Everybody” and the author of “Race Marxism,” as well as, “The Marxification of Education.” Dr. Lindsay has been a featured guest on Fox News, Glenn Beck, Joe Rogan, and NPR, and he has spoken at the Oxford Union and the EU Parliament.

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Dr. Steve Templeton discuss his recent publication, “Fear of a Microbial Planet: How a Germophobic Safety Culture Makes Us Less Safe.” They break down the “discussed response” of the behavioral immune system, the pathogenic treatment of people during the COVID pandemic, the shift toward perceptual safety over common good, the programmatically induced fear that censors open discussion around these topics even now, and the impenetrability of those afraid, even when met with fundamental truths.

Dr. Steve Templeton is the Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Indiana University School of Medicine Terre Haute, formerly CDC/NIOSH. Dr. Templeton is the author of the new publication, “Fear of a Microbial Planet: How a Germophobic Safety Culture Makes Us Less Safe.” The book examines pandemic responses, cultural and administrative, weighing historic examples against the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Dreams, Fairy Tales, and the Demons of AI | Jonathan Pageau | EP 364",2023-06-08T15:00:16Z,PT1H45M18S,389835,10995,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Ep. 364

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Jonathan Pageau discuss the depth of narrative found in the classic fairy tales, the loss of positively impactful narratives in the wake of woke culture, the potential utility of Ai as a means to prod new insights from historic and biblical texts, the cynicism of postmodernism, and the overall necessity to preserve foundational storytelling.

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Missouri senator Josh Hawley discuss his new book, “Manhood,” and break down the importance and depth of the biblical ideals that have shaped society - and particularly the west - in a historically unprecedented manner. 

Josh Hawley is a constitutional lawyer, the U.S. Senator for Missouri, and the bestselling author of “The Tyranny of Big Tech.” His newest publication, “Manhood: The Masculine Virtues America Needs,” is available now and seeks to defend the positive and necessary attributes of masculinity across leadership, governance, and the everyday structure of American life. Men of character are needed for a civilization to thrive, and today's America, the west, has openly sought to destroy the foundational and biblical principles that create them.

He is known for his work in the fields of ethics, philosophy, and theology, particularly in the context of war, peace, and historical reverence. Biggar has made significant contributions to the study of Christian ethics and has written extensively on topics such as “just war theory,” moral responsibility, and the role of forgiveness in conflict resolution.

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Brian Roemmele discuss the future of human civilization: a world of human androids operating alongside artificial intelligence with applications that George Orwell could not have imagined in his wildest stories. Whether the future will be a dystopian nightmare devoid of art or a hyper-charged intellectual utopia is yet to be seen, but the markers are clear … everything is already changing.

Brian Roemmele is a scientist, researcher, analyst, entrepreneur, and tech expert on the forefront of artificial intelligence. His current publication, Multiplex, offers itself as an experiment in journalism as he and his team give live updates on the empirical research they conduct in the field and advocate for the positive emergence and acceptance of AI in much the same way as personal computers.

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and twelve-time All-American female swimmer Riley Gaines discuss the insemination of men into women's spaces. Gaines breaks down the breach in security that women face when forced to share vulnerable spaces with biological men, the purpose of athletic achievement, why segregation of the sexes has genuine merit, and what exactly went down at San Francisco State University.

Riley Gaines is an American athlete and female rights activist. Gaines is a graduate from the University of Kentucky, where she was a twelve-time All-American swimmer. She competed and tied with trans-identifying swimmer Lia Thomas at their NCAA championships and was unfairly sidelined from the awards ceremony. She has spoken to numerous teammates and administrators who do not think this attack on female sports is fair, and more importantly, do not feel this invasion by men into female spaces is remotely safe. Gaines has become an outspoken female rights activist, advocating for the protection of women's spaces, sports, and achievements, and has proven herself unshakable even when faced with a dangerous mob.

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and journalist David Zweig discuss his role in breaking the Twitter Files, government censorship in society, the extent to which lockdowns were effective, how they affected children in particular, and how one renegade church would not bow to overzealous regulation.

David Zweig is a writer and journalist, with multiple books published, such as “Invisibles” in 2014 and the upcoming “Abundance of Caution” that centers on the effects of the COVID-19 response on schools and children. He was also one of the journalists who helped break the Twitter Files, focusing on the suppression of information to the satisfaction of the U.S. government and the public health establishment.

Peterson draws upon his extensive research and relatable real-life experiences to illustrate how to develop attainable goals for intimate relationships, meaningful friendships, and your career. Transform the chaotic potential of the future into actuality — with a vision. 

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and economist Peter Schiff discuss the gold standard, the corruption and impending failure of the fiat system in the wake of inflation, why politicians are pushing inflation to astronomical new levels, and why they’re lying about it. 

Peter Schiff is an economist, financial broker, author, frequent guest on national news, and host of the podcast, ""the Peter Schiff Show."" Starting in 2005 Schiff took notice of the red flags signaling that economic unrest was looming, and correctly predicted the 2008 housing crisis. His attempts to warn the general public across a multitude of news and radio networks earned him the nickname “Dr. Doom,” and ever since then he has been looked on as a source not only to watch, but heavily consider.

Peterson draws upon his extensive research and relatable real-life experiences to illustrate how to develop attainable goals for intimate relationships, meaningful friendships, and your career. Transform the chaotic potential of the future into actuality — with a vision. 

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Naomi Wolf discuss her original ambitions, the derailment of her scholarly career at the hands of misogyny, her rise to the forefront of third wave feminism as a best-selling author, and how the mainstream turned on her once she wrote on a topic the Left had blacklisted: COVID-19.

Naomi Wolf is an American author and journalist. Her first book, “The Beauty Myth,” would challenge notions of attraction, arguing they are societally fabricated. This publication became an international bestseller and cemented Wolf as one of the leading spokeswomen for the third wave feminist movement. She has published many books since then, such as “The End of America, and Vagina: A New Biography.” In recent years, she has come under fire for being an “anti-vaxer” and a “conspiracy theorist,” which led Wolf to write her most recent book, “The Bodies of Others: The New Authoritarians, COVID-19 and The War Against the Human.”

Peterson draws upon his extensive research and relatable real-life experiences to illustrate how to develop attainable goals for intimate relationships, meaningful friendships, and your career. Transform the chaotic potential of the future into actuality — with a vision. 

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Dr. Scott Jensen walk through his accomplished professional life in family medicine, as well as his successful run as a Minnesota senator, all before having his reputation in both fields dismantled for what may be purely political reasons. Six investigations across nearly five years and numerous allegations without cohesion, proof, or relation have amounted to nothing, save for the clarification of Dr. Jensen's newest goal: to take on the medical board that had no justification for its actions. Given the parallels between Dr. Jensen and Dr. Peterson’s experiences, this interview was not only inevitable but paramount.

Dr. Scott Jensen has practiced family medicine in Carver County, Minnesota, for 35 years. Jensen then served in the Minnesota Senate (2017-2021) and was vice-chair of the Health and Human Services Committee, as well as the Republican Governor candidate in the 2022 election. 

He has served many organizations as a board member or chair including the Waconia School Board, numerous Rotary and Lions clubs, several Chambers of Commerce, and bank boards. He is an avid pilot and writer, publishing his first book in 2015, “Relationship Matters” and his second book, “We’ve Been Played” in 2022. In 2001, he founded Catalyst Medical Clinic which now has offices located in Watertown and Chaska.

Watch Jordan Peterson's ""Vision & Destiny"" on DW+ https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8

Peterson draws upon his extensive research and relatable real-life experiences to illustrate how to develop attainable goals for intimate relationships, meaningful friendships, and your career. Transform the chaotic potential of the future into actuality — with a vision. 

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Miriam Grossman discuss the grief and trauma associated with the Transgender movement, not just for those transitioning, but for the parents and families who now find themselves shunned and alienated if they refuse to affirm their own child's delusion. They also go into detail on the history of the ideology, the monstrosity of Dr. John Money, and his horrendous failed experiment on which he built his doctrines.

Miriam Grossman MD is a physician, author, and public speaker. Before gender ideology was on anyone’s radar, she warned parents about its dangers in her 2009 book, “You’re Teaching My Child WHAT?” Dr. Grossman has been vocal for many years about the capture of her profession by ideologues, leading to dangerous and experimental treatments on children and betrayal of parents. Dr. Grossman was featured in the Daily Wire’s hit documentary “What Is A Woman?” The author of four books, her work has been translated into eleven languages. After graduating with honors from Bryn Mawr College, Dr. Grossman attended New York University Medical School.  She completed an internship in pediatrics at Beth Israel Hospital in New York City, and a residency in psychiatry through Cornell University Medical College, followed by a fellowship in child and adolescent psychiatry. Dr. Grossman is board certified in psychiatry and in the sub-specialty of child and adolescent psychiatry.

Peterson draws upon his extensive research and relatable real-life experiences to illustrate how to develop attainable goals for intimate relationships, meaningful friendships, and your career. Transform the chaotic potential of the future into actuality — with a vision. 

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Senator Mike Lee discuss the ever present conflict between Ukraine and Russia, the  role of the United States in that conflict via proxy war, the rise of ESG investing, why the top investment firms do not care about your values, and what Senator Lee plans to do about it.

Elected in 2010 as Utah's 16th Senator, Mike Lee has spent his career defending the fundamental liberties of all Americans and advocating for America's founding constitutional principles. Senator Lee acquired a deep respect for the Constitution early in life while watching his father, Rex E. Lee, serve as the Solicitor General under President Ronald Reagan. He attended most of his father's arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court, giving him a unique and up-close understanding of our government. Lee graduated from Brigham Young University with a degree in Political Science, and served as BYU's Student Body President in his senior year. Senator Lee serves as the Ranking Republican on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, in addition to serving on the Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands, Forests, and Mining and the Committee on the Budget.

12 Rules for the Good of the Planet | Bjørn Lomborg | EP 345,2023-04-03T15:00:27Z,PT2H53M5S,586184,9773,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Ep. 345

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Bjørn Lomborg go through each of the “doable dozen,” a series of issues that cost relatively little to solve, and yet doing so would yield exponential returns for developing countries and their impoverished citizens.

Bjørn Lomborg is a Danish author, having written numerous books on climate change such as “False Alarm,” “The Skeptical Environmentalist,” and “How to Spend $75 Billion to Make the World a Better Place.” He is the president of the think tank Copenhagen Consensus Center which focuses on doing the most good for the most people, with increasingly limited budgets. Bjørn's newest book, ""Best Things First,"" is now published and can be found using the link below!

Peterson draws upon his extensive research and relatable real-life experiences to illustrate how to develop attainable goals for intimate relationships, meaningful friendships, and your career. Transform the chaotic potential of the future into actuality — with a vision. 

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Derek Kreifels discuss the primary role of the state treasurer and why now, with the onslaught of ESGs and anti-fossil fuel divesting, their stewardship is so important. 

Derek Kreifels is the co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of the State Financial Officers Foundation (SFOF), the only nonprofit in the U.S. that combines ground-breaking free-market research with a strong network of states’ treasurers, auditors, and other financial officers, to actively sustain the health of each state’s economic outlook.
 
Before co-founding SFOF in 2012, Kreifels spent five years as Assistant State Treasurer of Kansas, where he oversaw the state’s college savings plan, ABLE plan, debt and bond management, and pension investments. During his tenure, his office processed over $21B annually, and he managed 42 employees with an annual budget of over $3.5M.

Parkour and Rough Play | Rafe Kelley | EP 343,2023-03-27T15:00:07Z,PT1H41M36S,533270,16047,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Ep. 343

Watch Jordan Peterson's ""Vision & Destiny"" on DW+ https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8

Peterson draws upon his extensive research and relatable real-life experiences to illustrate how to develop attainable goals for intimate relationships, meaningful friendships, and your career. Transform the chaotic potential of the future into actuality — with a vision. 

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and parkour expert Rafe Kelley discuss the importance of rough-and-tumble play for developing children, how a lifestyle centered around movement can expand our grasp and involvement with the natural world, and why society should value masculine activities, rather than adhering to the push for feminization in all aspects of modern life.

Rafe Kelley is an entrepreneur and advocate for a lifestyle centered around human movement. He suffered at a young age from ADHD, causing him to struggle in school. As it would happen, he came into contact with a mentor who recognized his need for play, encouraged time in nature, and taught him to productively roughhouse. This quickly resulted in Kelley advancing in his studies, launching him on his life path. In college, he studied anthropology and evolutionary biology, falling in love with martial arts and parkour along the way. He would go on to establish the first parkour gym on the west coast, Parkour Visions, before developing a new fitness lifestyle based on primal movement that Kelley calls “Evolve, Move, Play.”

Confessions of a Trans-Care Propagandist  | Sara Stockton | EP 342,2023-03-23T15:00:39Z,PT1H42M58S,2391867,50423,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Ep. 342

Watch Jordan Peterson's ""Vision & Destiny"" on DW+ https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8

Peterson draws upon his extensive research and relatable real-life experiences to illustrate how to develop attainable goals for intimate relationships, meaningful friendships, and your career. Transform the chaotic potential of the future into actuality — with a vision. 

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Sara Stockton explore her past as a clinician in the field of Transgender care, how she helped co-author the processes by which gender-dysphoric children are assessed for medical intervention, and why she wholeheartedly regrets it now.

Sara Stockton is a licensed marriage and family therapist, lecturer, researcher, presenter, and clinical supervisor of a psychotherapy group practice in Central New York. In 2012, she co-authored and published one of the first mental health assessments utilized to assess youth's readiness to begin medical treatment for gender transition. She spent the first part of her career as a clinician treating and advocating on behalf of youth and families surrounding issues with gender. Furthermore, she spent time traveling to teach medical facilities, physicians, and schools how to provide what we now refer to as “gender-confirming” care. Treating well over one hundred families, she also wrote many of the first letters that were used to approve gender transition surgeries on minors. However, due to many concerns with the treatment outcomes and how this ideology was being presented to children, she shifted her focus away from working primarily with this population. More recently, Sara Stockton was interviewed for a documentary to discuss some of the implications of what is happening developmentally to our children. Since appearing in that documentary, Sara Stockton receives constant emails and calls from medical professionals across the globe sharing their fears about speaking out and the lack of conversation around this serious topic.

Jordan Peterson Interviews Presidential Candidate Vivek Ramaswamy | EP 341,2023-03-20T15:15:01Z,PT1H40M48S,2229713,61128,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Ep. 341

Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Vivek Ramaswamy discuss ESG investing, the culture wars, the upcoming US presidential election, and Vivek’s recently announced candidacy.

Vivek is an American business leader and New York Times bestselling author of “Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam,” along with his second book, “Nation of Victims: Identity Politics, the Death of Merit, and the Path Back to Excellence.”

Born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio, he often recounts the sage advice from his father: “If you’re going to stand out, then you might as well be outstanding.” This set the course for his life: a nationally ranked tennis player, and the valedictorian of his high school, St. Xavier. He went on to graduate summa cum laude in Biology from Harvard and received his J.D. from Yale Law School while working at a hedge fund, then started a biotech company, Roivant Sciences, where he oversaw the development of five drugs that went on to become FDA-approved.

In 2022, he founded Strive, an Ohio-based asset management firm that directly competes with asset managers like BlackRock, State Street, Vanguard, and others, who use the money of everyday citizens to advance environmental and social agendas that many citizens and capital owners disagree with.

Peterson draws upon his extensive research and relatable real-life experiences to illustrate how to develop attainable goals for intimate relationships, meaningful friendships, and your career. Transform the chaotic potential of the future into actuality — with a vision. 

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson, Michael Yon, and Eva Vlaardingerbroek discuss recent events encircling the Dutch farmers protest, how their anti-globalist movement mirrors the Canadian Freedom Convoy, and how their message has resonated across the world despite best efforts to silence their voices.

At age 19, Michael Yon completed Green Beret training. His Green Beret experience taught him the art of observing and surviving in the most dangerous environments on earth. Combining his skills as a writer and a photographer, and with the encouragement of fellow veterans, Michael began his correspondent career by traveling to Iraq in December of 2004. That was the first step in his nearly 20-year journey—traveling the globe to report on world events firsthand. He has traveled to more than 80 countries including China, India, Bhutan, and Vietnam studying issues from cannibalism, information warfare, insurgency, protests, migration wars, and more.  His most recent journey has taken him from Asia to Europe, America, and Central and South America to study the conditions for global famine.

Eva Vlaardingerbroek is a Dutch political and cultural commentator and legal philosopher. She has been featured on Fox News, GB News, Tim Pool, 'Achtung, Reichelt' and many other media outlets across the world. She received her masters with honors from Leiden University in 2019 and after getting involved in Dutch politics, she's now made it her mission to be a conservative voice for freedom and justice in the Western world. Her motto in life and eponymously titled substack is 'Resit Much, Obey Little'

Peterson draws upon his extensive research and relatable real-life experiences to illustrate how to develop attainable goals for intimate relationships, meaningful friendships, and your career. Transform the chaotic potential of the future into actuality — with a vision. 

Dr. Jordan B Peterson and Stephen J Shaw discuss the Birthgap, a term recently coined by Shaw– and the subject of his new documentary by the same name. In this interview, they examine the long building but invisible causes of what may be the most pressing issue facing the western world in the next few decades. Worst case scenario: total societal collapse due to a lack of new children being born, and a rise in senior citizens living longer.

Stephen is a British national who has studied and lived on three continents. He trained as a computer engineer and data scientist before starting his first film project, “Birthgap,” at age 49. He is president and co-founder of the data analytics company, Autometrics Analytics LLC.

Stephen holds an MBA graduate business degree from ISG in Paris, France, and is continuing his studies at Harvard Extension School.

From here they discuss the affinities and gaps between Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, and explore the origin of ideology, as well as the technocratic tower of babel we as a species seem to be constructing.

Maajid Nawaz is a British anti-extremist, political commentator, activist, and podcast host. He was recently “released” from his LBC radio show for his views on the covid 19 pandemic, and has roots as one of the original named members of the supposed Intellectual Dark Web, along with characters such as Douglas Murray, Ben Shapiro, and Jordan Peterson.

Female Soldiers and Crony Capitalists | Tulsi Gabbard | EP 332,2023-02-16T16:00:05Z,PT1H24M24S,3062936,60353,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Ep. 332

Dr Jordan B Peterson and Tulsi Gabbard discuss her time in the armed forces, the concerns over women serving, crony capitalism, the Republican party, and the proxy war the US is waging against Russia.

Tulsi first served in elected office in the Hawaii State House of Representatives when she was 21 years old. Due to the attacks on 9/11, she enlisted in the Army National Guard. In 2004, she gave up an easy re-election campaign and volunteered to deploy to Iraq with the 29th Brigade Combat Team where she served in a medical unit. After returning home in 2006, Tulsi worked in the U.S. Senate as a legislative aide to the late Senator Danny Akaka, who was Chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. She then volunteered for a second Middle East deployment as a Platoon Leader.

Having experienced firsthand the true cost of war, Tulsi ran for United States Congress at age 31, vowing to honor the lives and sacrifice of her brothers and sisters in uniform. She prevailed in a difficult election and went on to serve in Congress for eight years as a member of the Armed Services, Homeland Security, and Foreign Affairs Committees. Foregoing a run for re-election to Congress, she ran as a Presidential candidate in the Democratic Party in 2020. Tulsi puts country before party and approaches every issue, domestic and foreign, based on ensuring the safety, security, and freedom of the American people.

The Predictions Are Wrong | Dr. Judith Curry | EP 329,2023-02-06T16:00:05Z,PT1H34M3S,1082089,37848,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Ep. 329

Dr Jordan B Peterson and Dr. Judith Curry discuss climate change, the major error in current models and future predictions, academic fraud, and the need for dissenting opinions.

Dr. Judith Curry is an American climatologist with a Bachelor’s degree in geography from Northern Illinois University, and a geophysical sciences Ph.D. from the University of Chicago. Curry is the professor Emerita and former Chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology. She has had an accomplished career, working with NASA, the US Government, and numerous academic institutions in the field of climate change. Curry advocates for a non-alarmist approach, acknowledging Earth’s rising temperature with a grain of salt—in-field research, and a refusal to shut the doors of science to those with opposing views and findings. In 2017 Dr. Curry retired from her position at the Georgia Institute of Technology, citing “the poisonous nature of the scientific discussion around man-made climate change” as a key factor. Curry co-founded and acts as president of the Climate Forecast Applications Network (CFAN), which seeks to translate cutting-edge weather and climate research into tenable forecast products.

Dr Jordan B Peterson and Dr. Del Paulhus delve deep into the Dark Tetrad: Machiavellianism, Narcissism, Psychopathy, and the newly added Sadism. From these four traits, researchers can quantify much of the darkness of humanity, and begin to study it in a way that yields numerical results, and the potential to make substantial predictions.

Dr. Delroy Paulhus is a personality researcher whose work in dark personality traits, via a variety of psychometric methods, has yielded measures of the Dark Tetrad. His work has also validated measures of socially desirable responding, perceived control, free will and determinism, and over-claiming. His work has been published in over 150 articles and books, and his current citation count exceeds 43,000.

Dr Jordan B Peterson and his daughter Mikhaila explain the current situation with the College of Psychologists of Ontario. They have presented Dr Peterson with an ultimatum: take part in re-education courses aiming to correct his “wrongthink,” or lose his clinical psychology license. 

Here is the promised documentation for the current charges and justification for the sentence already handed down by the College of Psychologists: https://drive.google.com/file/d/12XBZtXwsEZpXT7J7_-aFQQ1mTvvj4loW/view

Mikhaila Peterson is a CEO and the host of “The Mikhaila Peterson Podcast.” As well as interviews, she hosts a series called Opposing Views, where she speaks to people with differing opinions on contentious issues to let listeners make up their own minds. She’s used a diet called the Lion Diet to heal from autoimmune and mood disorders and has educated people on that diet via TEDx and Oxford Union speeches.

Mikhaila is also the founder of the upcoming online education platform Peterson Academy, an online education place devoid of ideology, launching in 2023.

Prayer as Psychological Sacrifice | Biblical Series: Exodus,2023-01-06T21:02:32Z,PT8M12S,375999,14287,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Jordan and the roundtable discuss chapters eighteen through twenty: Moses acts as a judge for his people, he reconciles with his family (especially his father-in-law Jethro), Jethro instructs Moses to see God as the true judge, and Moses teaches a select few the laws to allow them to rule over the people. Additionally, they review the initial events of Mount Sinai when God revealed himself to Moses, Israel as the sacrificial firstborn nation, and God’s presentation of the Ten Commandments. The scholars address the importance of sacrifice, compassion, and the relationship between justice and mercy; problems with unconditional love; and the fundamental structures of reality as the first half of the Exodus seminar comes to a close.

"Climate ""Science"" | Dr. Richard Lindzen | EP 320",2023-01-05T16:22:46Z,PT1H49M52S,1322340,38151,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Ep. 320

Dr Jordan B Peterson and Dr. Richard Lindzen dive into the facts of climate change, the models used to predict it, the dismal state of academia, and the politicized world of “professional” science.

Richard Lindzen is a dynamical meteorologist. He has contributed to the development of theories for the Hadley Circulation, hydrodynamic instability theory, internal gravity waves, atmospheric tides, and the quasi-biennial oscillation of the stratosphere. His current research is focused on climate sensitivity, the role of cirrus clouds in climate, and the determination of the tropics-to-pole temperature difference. He has attained multiple degrees from Harvard University, and won multiple awards in his field of study such as the Jule Charney award for “highly significant research in the atmospheric sciences”. Between 1983 and 2013, he was the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Atmospheric Sciences at MIT where he earned emeritus status in July of 2013.

Dr Jordan B Peterson sits down with 18 year old de-transitioner Chloe Cole. Chloe was indoctrinated, affirmed, and set on an irreparable path at the age of 15, and now finds herself abandoned by the community and the doctors that lead her over the edge.

Chloe Cole is an 18-year-old de-transitioner from The Central Valley of California. She started her transition at 12 years old, puberty blockers and testosterone at 13, and had a double mastectomy at 15 years old. She is now a strong advocate against gender ideology.

The scholars address the right hand of God, study of science as an apprenticeship, crossover of order and chaos, freely chosen consent, plagues brought about by tyranny, prayer and daily remembrance, and the human condition.

Raised in a far-left activist household, twenty-two-year-old Amala Ekpunobi was once a student organizer for the left. Unanswered questions–and a search for the truth–led her to a complete ideological transformation. Passionately sharing her new conservative values online, Amala became a viral social media sensation. Now the host of PragerU’s popular show “Unapologetic with Amala,” she inspires millions of young people every day to discover the truth, defend their values, and lead better lives.

Applications for Ralston College's MA in the Humanities for 2023 are now open. Dr. Peterson does not teach at Ralston. 
https://www.ralston.ac/humanities-ma

Ralston College presents the inaugural lecture of its Chancellor, Dr Jordan B Peterson, delivered at one of the most iconic sites of the ancient world, the Library of Celsus in Ephesus. This ancient city was the birthplace of Heraclitus, the philosopher who first articulated the idea of the Logos, and the final resting place of St. John, who uses that same Greek word to name the Divine Word. In his lecture, Dr Peterson argues that the intelligibility of the world depends on the patterned regularities that are superordinate to our immediate perception; this underlying order - which, from the Greeks onward, we have called Logos - is both the horizon that enables human perception and the basis for the possibilities that we realize in the world. Such an account of our intrinsic, rational, and self-determining capacity constitutes a challenge to the assumptions of many prevailing schools of thought - such as behaviorism, rigid empiricism, and postmodernism - and lays the burden of personal ethics, and the formation of a good society, squarely on the shoulders of the individual.

Peterson and Dr. Bjørn Lomborg discuss the present sense of impending doom that has swept the western world- and specifically today's young people.

Bjørn Lomborg is a Danish author, having written numerous books on climate change such as “False Alarm,” “The Skeptical Environmentalist,” and “How to Spend $75 Billion to Make the World a Better Place.” He is the president of the think tank Copenhagen Consensus Center that focuses on doing the most good, for the most people, with increasingly limited budgets. Previously, Lomborg was the director of the Danish government's Environmental Assessment Institute.

They also go into the importance of economic reform, the regression in progress seen through the lens of climate change, the spirit of democracy, and the inherent worth of man.

John Anderson is a sixth-generation farmer and grazier from New South Wales, Australia, who spent 19 years from 1989 in Parliament. He served as a senior Cabinet minister in the reformist government led by John Howard (1996 to 2005), one of the most successful governments in Australian parliamentary history.  This included six years as Leader of the National Party and Deputy Prime Minister. Despite no longer holding office, Anderson continues to serve the interests of Australia's rural and regional communities. In 2018, Anderson started an intellectual talk show/podcast hybrid, “Conversations with John Anderson,” that seeks out thought leaders from around the world to discuss and debate hard and necessary topics.

Showdown with Ottawa: Alberta's New Premier | Danielle Smith | EP 306,2022-11-17T19:04:41Z,PT1H32M47S,1421879,42576,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Dr Jordan B Peterson and Premier Danielle Smith discuss the election front in Alberta, the danger of intermittent power as winter arrives, the true utility of oil, and why the press needs to hold themselves to a higher standard once again.
 
Danielle Smith is a Canadian columnist, talk radio personality, talk show host, and politician, originally from Calgary. There she attended the University of Calgary, earning her bachelor's degree in English and economics. At this time, Smith became active in federal and provincial conservatism, and became the president of the campus PC Club. She also ran successfully for the board of trustees, and held the position for a year. After college, Smith became a columnist for the Calgary Herald. She would go on to succeed Charles Adler as host of the national current affair talk show, Global Sunday, as well as hosting two radio shows focused on health policy and property rights. In 2008, Smith left the PC party to much scrutiny, and joined the Wildrose Alliance. In the course of a year, across multiple elections, she had seen the party support base quadruple. In 2014, Smith once again joined the Provincial Conservative party, citing new leadership had been able to find common ground, with specific attention on economic standpoints. Due to this controversy, she was unable to win her next election, and opted instead to host the radio talk show CHQR, which she would later leave, along with Twitter, in response to egregious internet trolling. In May 2022, it was announced Smith would run for leadership of the United Conservative Party of Alberta, after the resignation of Jason Kenney. On October 6th, with 53 percent of the vote, she was sworn in as Premier.

Dr Jordan B Peterson and Dr. Yoram Hazony discuss the major problems plaguing today's youths, such as the resurgence of Marxism under the guise of woke morality, the creation of aimless social hierarchies that leave participants devoid of meaning, and the complete lack of respect for adverse thinking that has lead to the deterioration of our foundational principles.

Hazony has also served as director of the John Templeton Foundation's project in Jewish Philosophical Theology, as well as a member of the Israel Council for Higher Education committee. Dr. Hazony has published many books, his 2018 work, The Virtue of Nationalism, being awarded Conservative Book of the Year in 2019. He also maintains a regularly published blog, Jerusalem Letters, that explores the topics of philosophy, politics, Judaism, Israel, and higher education.

Andrew Schulz is an American stand up comic, podcast host, actor, and producer. Schulz began his standup journey in college at the University of California, where he also earned a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology.

Most recently in 2022, Schulz published yet another free-on-Youtube comedy special, Infamous, which he infamously chose not to release on major streaming platforms, despite express interest.

Michael Franzese is an American former mobster once affiliated with the Colombo crime family. Most notable for his gas-tax scheme from the mid 80’s, it is estimated that Franzese at one point was personally making eight million dollars a week. At his height Franzese had achieved the rank of Caporegime, or the equivalent of a captain or general within the mob ranks, and was nicknamed the “Yuppie Don” as well as the “Prince of the Mob,” by his contemporaries. In 1986, Franzese was sentenced to 10 years in prison for conspiracy charges, and despite being released early, spent the next decade in and out of jail. In 1994 he was finally released, chose to retire from crime, and bought an estate in Florida. Since then he has traveled the world as a public speaker, and has written many books about his life and crimes, such as 1992’s Quitting the Mob, or his most recent 2022 publication, Mafia Democracy.

Senator Hawley is recognized as one of the nation’s leading constitutional lawyers. He has litigated at the Supreme Court of the United States, the federal courts of appeals, and in state court, fighting for the people’s liberties. He previously fought Obamacare at the Supreme Court — and won — as one of the lead attorneys in the landmark Hobby Lobby case. Since taking office in 2019, Senator Hawley has been a leading champion in Congress for working families. He’s worked across the aisle to deliver protections for kids online, led the fight for direct payments to working people during the COVID-19 pandemic, and taken steps to crack down on predatory landlords. Currently, Senator Hawley is writing a book set for a 2023 release.

Mohammed Hijab is an author, comparative religionist, and philosopher of scripture. He is the co-founder of the Sapience Institute and is a researcher and instructor for the organization. He has a BA in Politics and a master’s degree in History. He has also acquired a second master’s in Islamic Studies from the School of Oriental and African Studies, as well as a third master’s degree in Applied Theology from the University of Oxford. Currently, he is working toward his PhD in Philosophy of Religion. Having completed Islamic seminary courses, he is one of very few Muslims who has been given formal permission to relay Islamic knowledge on selected Islamic fields, dealing with comparative, political, and theological issues. In his efforts, he has amassed a substantial following on YouTube, aided in part by authoring books such as “The Scientific Deception of the New Atheists.”
 
Jonathan Pageau is a French-Canadian liturgical artist and icon carver, known for his work featured in museums across the world. He carves Eastern Orthodox and other traditional images and teaches an online carving class. He also runs a YouTube channel dedicated to the exploration of symbolism across history and religion.

Piers Morgan is a British journalist and television personality who started his career working as a freelance writer for the Sun. Later he would be chosen by Rupert Murdock as editor for his publication, News of the World. This appointment would make Morgan the youngest British news editor (29) in more than fifty years. He would go on to be the editor of publications such as the Daily Mirror and MailOnline before ramping into a career on television. He would introduce documentaries for the BBC, and had a channel 4 political interview show with Amanda Platell, all before his stint as a judge on America’s Got Talent. Morgan would compete on and win the 2008 season of Celebrity Apprentice, and later famously interview the show's host, Donald Trump, after he had become the 45th US President. Morgan would work on numerous talk shows and documentary series before starting his current day production, Piers Morgan Uncensored. This show, on which controversial and celebrity guests debate Morgan, would be the first launched on talkTV, and welcome back President Trump for its premiere and second episodes.

Eugenics: Flawed Thinking Behind Pushed Science | Alex Story | EP 294,2022-10-06T15:00:31Z,PT1H38M44S,450110,13517,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Alex Story and Dr Jordan B Peterson discuss biology and overpopulation, the misguided thinking behind eugenics, and the tendency of politics to weaponize our totalitarian impulses.
 
Alex Story was an Olympic class rower for Great Britain, and attended the University of Cambridge. There he set the rowing course record against Oxford in the 1998 Boat Race, a record held for multiple decades. After suffering a career-ending back injury, Story turned his attention to politics, and quickly became a notable voice in the Conservative party. He stood for parliamentary office three times, representing some of the poorest areas in the country. Today he works in the finance sector as head of sales for a US brokerage firm. He has also become a writer, seeing his articles published weekly in magazines such as the National Inquirer and Express.

Douglas Murray and Jonathan Pageau | EP 290,2022-09-22T15:00:02Z,PT1H34M44S,684775,18027,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Jonathan Pageau, Douglas Murray, and Dr Jordan B Peterson discuss our hierarchies of perception, existence, faith, and whether meaning is a self evident truth or something intangible that is sought in vain.

Jonathan Pageau is a French-Canadian liturgical artist and icon carver, known for his work featured in museums across the world. He carves Eastern Orthodox and other traditional images, and teaches an online carving class. He also runs a YouTube channel dedicated to the exploration of symbolism across history and religion.

Douglas Murray is a British political commentator and author. In 2007 he founded a think tank called the Center for Social Cohesion, which later became part of the Henry Jackson Society. Currently he is an associate editor for the magazine the Spectator, where he became somewhat infamous after organizing a competition in which entrants were invited to submit offensive poems about Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, with a top prize of £1,000. He has authored five books, the most recent of which being “The War on the West.”

Why Are Young People Converting to Conservatism? | Eric Duhaime | EP 289,2022-09-19T15:00:07Z,PT1H43M59S,329769,12425,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh

Canada is facing a conflict of wills. Trudeau stands on his high pillar of morality, self-justifying actions that impact everyone from farmers to the current youth generation. Eric Duhaime, leader of the Conservative party of Quebec, discusses pressing issues for his province, and how he plans to fight back.

Before winning his election campaign with 95.99 percent of the vote, he was a published columnist and radio host. He has written for Journal De Montreal, and the National Post, as well as numerous blogs such as Les Analystes and Journal De Quebec. His radio show, Le retour d'Éric Duhaime, broadcasted from FM93 in Quebec City. Duhaime is also an accomplished author, having written such books as “La SAQ pousse le bouchon!” and “Libérez-nous des syndicats.”

Arabs vs Jews? Maybe Not | Ambassador Ron Dermer | EP 288,2022-09-15T15:00:27Z,PT1H47M44S,163341,4956,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh

The numerous heated and hotly debated conflicts surrounding Israel are almost always threatening to boil over and cast the Middle East into unceremonious chaos. Ambassador Ron Dermer sits down with Dr Jordan B Peterson to discuss the issues, the misnomers, and the underlying truths surrounding one of the most resilient peoples and countries in history. 

Ron Dermer is an American-born political consultant who served as Israel’s Ambassador to the United States from 2013 to 2021. As Prime Minister Netanyahu’s top advisor, Dermer was a driving force behind many of the era’s most important diplomatic developments, such as the monumental Abraham Accords, which normalized Israel’s relations with several Arab nations. 

Dermer earned a degree in Finance and Management from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania and a degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) from Oxford University.  After moving to Israel, Dermer became a columnist for The Jerusalem Post and served as a close advisor to Natan Sharansky.  In 2004, he co-authored with Sharansky the best-selling book, “The Case For Democracy: The Power of Freedom to Overcome Tyranny and Terror,” which has been translated into ten languages.

Queen Elizabeth II passed away hours before Dr Jordan B Peterson would give a public lecture. At this event, he was asked, “how could the death of the Queen affect the boundaries between English communities around the world?” His answer was honest and thought-provoking. He explores the weight and grandeur of the monarchical system, the legacy of its longest-reigning Queen, and the great loss so many have to bear.

Navy SEAL Mindset | Congressman Dan Crenshaw | EP 286,2022-09-08T15:00:03Z,PT1H58M27S,332443,9530,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh

In a world wrought with political deceptions, tribal entanglements, and the inequitable distribution of suffering, it’s no wonder that so many people feel completely lost in the search for purpose. Congressman Dan Crenshaw sits down with Dr Jordan B Peterson to discuss these dragons that we all face, and the kind of mindset it takes to defeat them.

US Representative Dan Crenshaw was formerly a Navy SEAL, serving his country in five tours of duty, and achieving the rank of Lieutenant Commander. He famously lost his right eye after an IED explosion during his third tour, but still served for another four years thereafter. He is currently a Congressman and  public speaker, talking to the points of mental solidarity and ethics, even in the face of adversity. He has also recently published the novel, “Fortitude: American Resilience in the Era of Outrage.”

How to Make the World a Better Place | Bjørn Lomborg and Ralph Schoellhammer | EP 285,2022-09-05T15:00:10Z,PT1H51M24S,570238,15553,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh

Leftist politicians and the “intellectual elite” prioritize a vague plan for saving earth over the lives of struggling people all over the world. Governments are being forced to press their citizens, straining already fragile economic and agricultural systems, in order to appease a globalist utopian vision. Bjørn Lomborg and Ralph Schoellhammer sit down with Dr Jordan B Peterson to discuss the faults in this plan, and the people who are suffering because of it.

Bjørn Lomborg is a Danish author, having written numerous books on climate change such as “False Alarm,” “The Skeptical Environmentalist,” and “How to Spend $75 Billion to Make the World a Better Place.” He is the president of the think tank Copenhagen Consensus Center that focuses on doing the most good, for the most people, with increasingly limited budgets. Previously, Lomborg was the director of the Danish government's Environmental Assessment Institute.

Ralph Schoellhammer is a scholar and journalist operating in Europe who has diligently covered overlooked stories such as the Dutch Farmers Protest. He is also an assistant Professor of international relations at Webster Vienna Private University, and produces a podcast following political psychology and institutionalism called the Global Wire.

Dr. Jordan B Peterson and Magatte Wade discuss how economic freedom dictates the success potential of countries, and how Africa’s fixation on colonialism being the cause of their modern day struggles, rather than bureaucratic red tape, is what’s locking the continent into abject poverty.

Magatte Wade is an entrepreneur for change, having focused her efforts first on raising awareness and capital with her lip balm company, Skin is Skin. She would then become a TED Global Africa Fellow, giving lectures with the aim of changing the course of Africa’s history, and giving the rich continent a brighter future based on the free market.

Mean Tweets: An Apologia | Pageau and Hurwitz | EP 282,2022-08-26T03:27:05Z,PT2H26M20S,889698,22752,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh

Jonathan Pageau and Gregg Hurwitz sit down with Dr. Jordan B Peterson to discuss a few of his recent controversial tweets covering topics of transgenderism, the body positivity movement, and the election of supreme court justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson. In this they seek to explore and debate how Petersons role in society, and thus how he represents himself to the public, can spark or shut down the conversation.

Hurwitz is an American novelist, screenwriter, and comic book writer. He is known for authoring the “Orphan X” series, along with a wide range of films such as “The Book of Henry” (2017) and “The Rise of Jordan Peterson” (2019). Pageau is a liturgical artist and professional icon carver, known for his work featured in museums across the world.

"Trudeau, Travel, and “The Science” | EP 281",2022-08-23T22:15:03Z,PT1H48M24S,337506,14713,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s recent covid mandates - specifically on travel bans for those who choose not to get vaccinated - have arguable basis in science, logic, and precedent. Today Dr. Jordan B Peterson sits down with five experts investigating the matter from all angles, including Rupa Subramanya, one of few Canadian journalists who dared to report an alternative perspective on the now infamous trucker protest that took place in Ottawa. Shaun Rickard and Karl Harrison, represented by lawyer Sam Presvelos, are three proud Canadians currently entangled in a lawsuit with their own government over Trudeau’s travel bans on public transport. Bruce Pardy is a professor of law at Queen’s University and the executive director of Rights Probe.

Critical Racists | Christopher Rufo | EP 280,2022-08-18T22:30:02Z,PT1H31M54S,603640,18859,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh

Christopher Rufo cast himself into the middle of controversy as he sought to bring light to the inner workings of American academia, and more specifically, how our institutions have begun to funnel in a new and ultimately detrimental worldview, critical race theory. He sits down with Dr Jordan B Peterson to discuss the subject, delving into the true threat that has breached thousands of publicly funded schools.

Rufo is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. Before this he was a visiting fellow for domestic policy studies at The Heritage Foundation, as well as a Lincoln fellow at the Claremont Institute, and a research fellow at the Discovery Institute of Washington. In his early career, he worked in the documentary filmmaking field, where he saw first hand how impoverished communities in the United States operate, and more appropriately continue to struggle under a cycle of seemingly inescapable destitution.

He is the author of two books, “No Way Home: The Crisis of Homelessness,” and “How to Fix It with Intelligence and Humanity.” Today he publishes a show dedicated to these topics on his YouTube channel, “Christopher Rufo Theory.""

Christopher Rufo's early experiences led him to publicly stand against the rapidly growing movement we see today to teach Critical Race Theory in schools, focusing mainly on K through 12. He argues that CRT looms as “an existential threat to the United States.”

As the Ambassador to Israel under President Donald Trump, David Friedman accomplished many things including the historical passing of the Abraham Accords. Ambassador Friedman joins to discuss his time under President Trump and how the accords came to fruition.

David Melech Friedman (born August 8, 1958) is an American bankruptcy lawyer and the former United States Ambassador to Israel. He joined the law firm Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman (then known as Kasowitz, Hoff, Benson & Torres) in 1994, where he met and represented Donald Trump, then chairman and president of The Trump Organization.

He was an advisor to Trump during his successful presidential campaign. In December 2016, President-elect Trump's transition team announced that Friedman was Trump's nominee for ambassador. He was narrowly confirmed by the Senate, officially sworn in by Vice President Mike Pence on March 29 and presented his credentials on May 15 to Israeli President Reuven Rivlin.

Deeper Yet Into The Weeds | Pageau & Vervaeke | EP 277,2022-08-08T23:00:18Z,PT2H31M49S,333648,8905,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"This was the first time that Jonathan Pageau, John Vervaeke, and Jordan Peterson all sat down together in person. Recorded in Dr. Peterson’s home, and prominently featuring many of Kwakwakaʼwakw carver Charles Joseph’s incredible statues and carvings, this recording may require a few complete watch-throughs. The conversation was created to intentionally dive deep into the areas of systems of perception and their impacts on our abilities to prioritize, the nature of YHWH (Judeo-Christian God), and the exploration of the True, the Good, and the Beautiful. This conversation is only the beginning of many more conversations to have between these three and on these topics. Please comment any insights that you have derived from this video, my team will be paying close attention to the progress on these ideas.

Jonathan Pageau is a symbolic thinker, YouTuber, and class carver of orthodox icons. Jordan and Jonathan have an ongoing dialogue surrounding Judeo-Christian narrative, reality, and symbolism among many other topics.

John Vervaeke is an Associate Professor in Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Science at the University of Toronto. His work constructs a bridge between science and spirituality in order to understand the experience of meaningfulness and the cultivation of wisdom so as to afford awakening from the meaning crisis.

Conservative Resistance in Canada | Roman Baber | EP 273,2022-07-25T22:45:00Z,PT1H3M58S,195608,9796,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Canadian Politician Roman Baber joins Dr. Peterson to discuss the state of the Conservative Party in Canada and their approach to climate change, and the devastating hit Canada's reputation has taken at the international level.

Roman Baber is a former Member of Ontario's Provincial Parliament. He is running for Leader of the Conservative Party of Canada because he will not ""sit back while Canadians are losing faith in Canada's democracy and Canadian opportunity."" He was removed by Doug Ford from the Ontario government caucus after calling out the collateral harm of lockdowns in January 2021. Since then, Roman has been a staunch advocate in favour of a balanced covid response and in particular against lockdowns due to their toll on the health and mental health of Canadians. Roman brought legislation to cut MPP pay to CERB levels while Emergency Orders are in place, commenced and is in litigation against the Attorney General of Ontario over Canadians' right to protest and worship outdoors and recently brought a Bill to outlaw workplace mandates. Roman is passionate about and is well familiar with justice, transit and autism policy.

Roman was born and lived in the former Soviet Union until he was almost 9. He then lived in Israel until he immigrated to Canada with his family at age 15 and settled in the heart of the north Toronto district he now represents. Roman obtained a BA from York University and graduated from law school at the University of Western Ontario. During his last year of law school, Roman was a supervisor with the school's legal aid funded clinic. Roman was called to the Ontario Bar in 2006 and practiced civil and commercial litigation until his election in 2018. He served as Chair of the Ontario Provincial Parliament’s Standing Committee on Justice Policy from September 2019 until January 2021.

Roman is an occasional lecturer at an after-school program, engaging high school students on constitutional and criminal law topics. He loves Canadian kindness, the Toronto Raptors and his special someone, Nancy Marchese.

He has been interviewed by Oprah, Barbara Walters, Tucker Carlson, Peter Jennings, and many others. Dr. Farrell conducts communication workshops, and his writings have been frequently featured in The New York Times.

In this episode, Dr. Farrell and I discuss issues that lead to mass homicides committed by young men. We also talk about child-rearing and boundary enforcement, discriminating between male competence and male power compulsion, and the importance of recognizing and rewarding a father’s contributions to their children’s development.

I discussed gratitude, faith, and suffering in this conversation at the Franciscan University of Steubenville. How can we be sure that pain is a solid guiding principle as we navigate the world? What is the underlying structure of pain, and what does it point at?

We also touched on a myriad of topics around those central themes, such as sin and the symbol of the snake, giving advice, resurrection, the relationship between faith and suffering, evil, the effect we have on others, and sunsets.

You Probably Should Have Read the Bible | Franciscan University | EP 251,2022-05-09T16:09:22Z,PT53M59S,1261062,33644,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"This episode was recorded on April 4, 2022.

In this speech at the Franciscan University of Steubenville, Jordan shared recent thoughts on ethics, scripture, and the problem of perception. He asked the audience to reflect on how we remember great stories (but seem to instantly forget bad ones), why Western culture ended up being a book (instead of—say—a sickle), and whether the West truly is a “phallogocentric"" culture.

All of this, Jordan says, tied to a broader possibility—perhaps his “most radical claim""—that, as we navigate the value structures we call reality, a lot of so-called “navigational” problems are really veiled ethical ones.

Step by step, he goes through his own process for critical thinking so that listeners can replicate it.

What constitutes critical thinking? Why think at all? What is the 'dialectical process' in critical thinking? How can we refine our ideas? And where should they even come from?

Primatologist Explains the 1% Difference Between Humans & Apes | Richard Wrangham | EP 249,2022-05-02T16:02:23Z,PT1H45M8S,1336200,28906,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"This conversation was recorded on September 1, 2021.

I spoke to Richard Wrangham about his research on ape behavior. We explored prerequisites for chimp attacks, how cooking shaped human cognitive development, studying chimps in the wild with Jane Goodall, DNA similarity studies, proactive vs. reactive aggression, and more.

Richard is a biological anthropologist at Harvard, specializing in the study of primates and the evolution of violence, sex, cooking, and culture. He’s also a MacArthur fellow—the so-called “genius grant”—and the author of books like 'The Goodness Paradox: The Strange Relationship Between Virtue and Violence in Human Evolution' and 'Demonic Males: Apes and the Origins of Human Violence.'

In part 2 of this compilation, we examine the power of free speech and potential responses to censorship. 

After a lecture excerpt on the “initial defeat of the hero,” we transition into conversations on hate crime laws, the idea behind 'No Safe Spaces,’ and the events that lead Paul Rossi, a NY private school teacher, to take a stand against seminars on ""white dominant culture"" being taught as gospel. We also travel across the pond to have Andrew Doyle explain recent hate crime laws passed in the UK Parliament, and why they affect citizens more broadly than you may think.

In part 1 out of 4 of this compilation series, we look at excerpts from the Maps of Meaning lecture series as well as how issues around free speech have affected Bret Weinstein, Heather Heying, Yeon Mi Park, Arif Ahmed, Dennis Prager, Rima Azar, James Orr, and Paul Rossi. 

This ties to Dr. Peterson’s recent lecture at Cambridge, which he titled Why Free Speech Is the Antidote to Our Problems. In keeping with that motif, we hope this compilation inspires you to speak the truth and protect our most fundamental rights as sovereign individuals.

In November 2021, Dr. Peterson traveled to the United Kingdom to give a series of lectures at Oxford and Cambridge. This lecture was given at Lady Mitchell Hall at the University of Cambridge on November 23rd, 2021.

Dr. Peterson gives an in-depth exploration of the problem of perception. In doing so, he touches on orienting reflexes, artificial intelligence, the infinite possibilities parsed by perception, neurophysiology, postmodernism, and the relationship between imitation, awe, and the divine, before answering questions from the audience about the direction of Western civilization, meaning, and the notion of humans as simple biological machines.

ANTIFA: The Rise of the Violent Left | Andy Ngo | EP 239,2022-03-28T16:09:42Z,PT1H35M50S,420993,21389,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"This episode was recorded on November 8th, 2021

Andy Ngo is an independent journalist and photographer who lives under constant threats for his reporting and expertise on American Antifa and the militant far-left. He has testified before the U.S. Congress, appeared on countless TV shows, radio programs, and podcasts, and has been featured in the Wall Street Journal, New York Post, Newsweek, Fox News, National Review, and more. Andy is currently the editor-at-large at the Post Millennial.

In this episode, I discuss Andy’s experiences with Antifa, race riots, autonomous zones, and the ‘summer of love’ in Seattle. We also exchanged thoughts on the psychology of mob violence, journalistic integrity, dealing with criticism, using people for political ends, attempts to destabilize the police, and lots more.

Warning: Bill 67,2022-03-11T17:46:29Z,PT5M53S,699465,43271,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"A warning to citizens of Ontario and Canada: Bill 67, which purports to be nothing but an ""anti-racist"" bill, is in fact the most pernicious and dangerous piece of legislation that any Canadian government has attempted to put forward. 

It will make mandatory the subversion of the entire education system in Ontario (K-12 as well as colleges and universities) to the radically leftist doctrines known as critical theory--a thoroughly anti-western ideology, both post-modern and Marxist in its derivation, based on the idea that all our extant institutions are racist, sexist and discriminatory in their essence. Critical theorists assume that history is best understood as the war between identity groups, with one group always oppressing, and all other groups always victimized and exploited. Critical theorists dismiss the idea of the sovereign, free individual, claiming that belief in such sovereignty and freedom does nothing but justify the oppression and exploitation of the marginalized. In keeping with that rejection, such theorists assume that human identity itself is best understood at the group level, with markers of race, sex, so-called gender, and sexual preference dominating. Critical theorists reject the presumption of individual innocence absent proof of wrongdoing, assuming that membership in a group regarded as dominant and exploitative is sufficient to indicate the moral culpability of any given member of that group. Critical theorists define offense and harm as subjectively determined: anyone who feels victimized by any statement made by anyone for any reason is fully justified in their feeling and claim of harm, regardless of the intent of the author of the statement, who is then to be deemed guilty of such victimization, and denied even the opportunity for a reasonable defense. Bill 67 will mandate the creation of boards of inquisition in every educational institution, to which anyone who has an opinion or undertakes an action that is perceived to violate the tenets of critical theory will be made subject to punishment. 

The author of this bill, MPP Laura Mae Lindo (NDP, Kitchener-Centre), is former head of equity at Laurier University. It was Laura Mae Lindo who developed the policies that resulted in the circumstances that enveloped Lindsay Shepherd in 2017, which produced a scandal provincially, nationally and internationally, left a permanent stain on the reputation of Canadian universities, and demolished that young woman's academic ambitions and future. 

The fact that the Ontario Conservative government has allowed and even encouraged such legislation to be put forward under their aegis and then ignorant and careless enough to vote in support for it is a woeful indication of both the perniciousness and deviance of the ideas that the legislation contains and evidence of their own stunning and continual inability to see the danger such doctrines present. It is much harder to actually deal with the sometimes unjust distribution of privileges and resources in a complex society than to kowtow to radicals who know how to viciously accuse, weaponize guilt, and claim through manipulative sloganeering the moral upper hand. But there is no excuse for the Conservatives and for the classical liberals who also believe in the sovereignty of the individual to trumpet their compassion for the oppressed by allowing authoritarian ideologues to gain their treacherous way. 

This bill threatens the integrity of all the systems that will educate all the young people in Ontario for decades to come. The fact that it is already through second reading is inexcusable.

Wake up, Canadians. Before you do yourself and your children irreparable harm.

The personality assessment mentioned by Mr. Carr is https://understandmyself.com

Jimmy Carr is an award-winning comedian, author, and TV host. Carr recently came under fire for the career-enders subsection in His Dark Material, a Netflix special that’s deemed “deeply offensive” or “faithful to its title,” depending on who you ask. Carr’s latest book, Before & Laughter, is part memoir, part life advice, and mostly funny. 

We had a stimulating conversation about human nature, comedy and the physiology of laughter, experiencing jokes, half-filled rooms, truth, growth, self-deprecation, love languages, religion, and the 15’ replica of his head.

Dr. Kagan is a wealth of information on military history, geopolitics, Putin's relationship with the USSR (which his father helped defend) and Ukrainian sovereignty, and other aspects of what’s most certainly a moment in human history that won’t be forgotten soon.

Message to the Truckers,2022-02-14T18:01:39Z,PT2M32S,1360808,96000,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"I've been asked to say a few words to the truckers in Ottawa. I've given that some careful consideration. You protesters have accomplished an awful lot already. The conservative leadership has crumbled. Erin O'Toole has been replaced by someone who is giving a fair bit of voice to your concerns.

All the people you represent have a voice in the house of commons. You have four provinces that have moved quite precipitously in the direction that the protest was hoping for. They are starting to lift mask mandates on something approximating as reasonable a timeline as might be expected under the circumstances. You're now faced with a difficult choice: what are your criteria for satisfaction.

You need to determine that so that you can negotiate with the necessary people. You're also faced with another danger at the moment, now that which is that the political process bent in the direction that you've insisted upon - rightly, in my estimation. This, more and more of you who are most reasonable are going to pack up and leave, or decide that this is done sometime over the next week or so (or a couple of weeks: that's obviously up to you) --, but there'll be a remnant that's much more committed in some sense to more extreme goals. That's going to be something very difficult to manage.

I'd like to commend all of you for your diligence and work -- on accomplishing what you have accomplished under trying conditions -- and also for keeping your heads in a way that's been a model for the entire world. You've been able to remain peaceful. You haven't taken the bait. You haven't responded with violence to quite remarkable denigration and provocation. That's a sign of tremendous discipline and care. It's going to get more difficult to maintain as this goes along. So I hope that you're all able to allow a sufficient victory to be sufficient, to move forward without greed -- to be grateful for the effect that you've already had, and the support you've received, to move forward to a normative peace and the re-establishment of our country's economy and our psychological and social wellbeing. That's pretty much all I have to say at this point. Thank you.

Dr. Julie Ponesse is a philosopher specializing in applied ethics, bioethics, and ancient philosophy. Unfortunately, 20 years in academia came to an end after failing to comply with a vaccine mandate at the University of Western Ontario.

Then, in a video response aimed at 1st-year ethics students, she spelled out her position on forced medical procedures.

Her response went viral. 

Dr. Ponesse has since become the Pandemic Ethics Scholar for The Democracy Fund, through which she published My Choice: The Ethical Case Against Covid-19 Vaccine Mandates.

Charles Joseph is a Kwakwaka’wakw artist known for his masks, totem poles, and canoes. His work can be found in homes and businesses worldwide, including mine. His “Residential School Totem” stands before the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts for “all Canadians, not just residential school survivors.” It represents Charles’ “reconciliation” and his “story is on the pole.”

Brian Peckford and I discussed his reentry to the political arena after denouncing the Canadian Government for infringements on the Canadian Charter of Rights--a document he played a key role in drafting. In this intense conversation, Peckford outlines a combined plan of action against the Canadian Government over their COVID-19 response and ongoing use of power.

Starting his career as an educator, the Honorable Brian Peckford then served as the premier of Newfoundland and Labrador for nearly a decade. He is also an author, former minister, and notable member of the PC Party.

Chloé Valdary and I discuss The Theory of Enchantment, her personal brand of compassionate anti-racism. Chloé has been featured in Psychology Today and the NY Times. Her work with Theory of Enchantment attempts to bring compassion to diversity training and fight bigotry with love.

We covered a range of topics surrounding her practice, structural racism in the US, the civil rights movement, the best way to criticize one another, the power of Truth, white fragility, and what one could expect from her (rather unique) diversity seminars.

Dr. Arif Ahmed and Dr. James Orr come on to discuss what led to the University of Cambridge rescinding my invitation to speak there. We get into the difficulty of change in universities, anonymous reporting, the dangers of limiting free speech, microaggressions, the importance of humor, and more.

Arif Ahmed MBE is a philosopher, lecturer at Cambridge, and author of “Saul Kripke”. His interests include decision theory and religion from an atheist and libertarian point of view. In the aftermath of the Cambridge incident, Dr. Ahmed remained a vocal advocate for political diversity. 

Dr. James Orr is a university lecturer in philosophy of religion at Cambridge and author of “The Mind of God and the Works of Nature.” He is a regular contributor to The Times Literary Supplement and The Critic.

Shownotes:
_______________
[00:00] Jordan Peterson is interviewed by Mikail Avdeev, a member of his foreign translations team. They begin the discussion by talking about the forming of the international translation teams.
[02:00] The healing effect of Jordan's lectures. The outcry for new material from Jordan’s catalog of books, lectures, and podcasts has been overwhelming. 
[04:00] Espousing the profundity of Eric Neumann’s works in his “The Origins and History of Consciousness and The Great Mother.”
[05:20] Peterson comments on another personal favorite author of his, Mircea Eliade, and his history of religious ideas - an anthropological and sociological assessment of religion that’s also deeply psychological.
[06:40] How Russians respond to Jordan's affinity for Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Mikail details the feelings of the Russian people by their portrayal after the fall of communism.
[10:00] How we deal with the guilt of the things our ancestors or society have done: a very difficult question because we are very historical creatures. The best thing for us is to try to understand what happened and avoid making the same mistakes twice.
[13:30] Examining the trope that all white people are racist; the existential guilt of history.
[20:00] Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and Daniel Dennett seem to hold that religious belief is a set of propositions about the material world (in a way a direct competitor to scientific theory) and that’s just not fully accurate. There is something outside of strict rationality in the human experience.
[24:00] Gibson’s visual perception theory. Value is the key to our perception of the world around us.
[34:20] Fragmentation of the value structure necessarily leads to an increased level of constant anxiety in all experience.
[36:30] What parts of modern society are contributing to the integrity of consciousness, and what things are degrading that. A hatred for real success and striving for personal gain will tear us apart if left unchecked.
[43:30] There is no doubt that economic exploitation occurs and that some wealth is gained in an unethical manner - but that is not the rule.
[45:45] On the importance of beauty in personal experiences as well as the collective human experience.

Evolution and the Challenges of Modern Life | Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying | EP 216,2022-01-10T17:34:38Z,PT1H33M24S,749105,23402,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"This episode was recorded on October 5th, 2021.

Podcasters and evolutionary biology power-couple Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying join me to discuss a variety of topics related to their new book, A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century. We explore topics like niche-switching, what Darwin got wrong, Twitter, sources for modern values, hyper-novelty, the aftermath of progress, parenthood, and sexual selection – just to name a few.
Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying are evolutionary biologists, former Evergreen State College professors, and the current hosts of the DarkHorse podcast. You may also know Bret through Joe Rogan, or as the twice-moderator for Jordan’s debates with Sam Harris. 
The couple’s book, titled “A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century: Evolution and the Challenges of Modern Life,” asks why the most prosperous age in history has scarcely offset suicide rates, tribal division, loneliness, and human misery.

[00:00] Intro
[00:30] Guests’ background
[01:32] A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century – why they wrote it
[04:30] “Values might not be [scientifically] defensible. Taken to the extreme, it might be hard to explain why existing is better than not"" - Bret Weinstein
[05:07] “We believe that any credible 'ought' needs to be scientifically informed"" - BW
[05:45] Learning to negotiate hyper-novelty in the modern world. The extremely fast rate of progress and change
[06:56] “The amazing rate of change we’ve created is itself deranging us and making it very difficult to understand and remember how to be human” - Heather Heying

[22:45] Twitter as a giant social experiment; what happens when you can (sort of) communicate with everyone?

[29:57] Small talk, gaging social skills, and nonverbal cues

Fortitude: American Resilience | Dan Crenshaw | EP 214,2022-01-03T19:13:59Z,PT1H43M35S,324009,11201,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"This episode was recorded on September 30, 2021.

Congressman Dan Crenshaw and I discuss the fallout of withdrawing from Afghanistan and the details of the 20-plus-year conflict. We talk about life as a US congressman and his experience as a US Navy SEAL. About social media and politics–especially in relation to modern conservatism. And about climate change. On that note, we also examined Dan’s recently-published ”Fortitude: American Resilience in the Era of Outrage.”

Dan is a retired Navy SEAL with five deployments overseas during the Afghan and Iraq wars. While in Afghanistan, an IED blast led to Dan losing his right eye. Crenshaw was elected to Congress in 2018, where he serves on the Energy and Commerce Committee (broadest jurisdiction out of all legislative committees). Dan also serves on the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis.

[00:00] Intro
[02:30] Dan Crenshaw explains the situation in Afghanistan over the last 20 years
[4:15] “We decided that the Taliban should no longer be in control of Afghanistan. That was day one” - Dan Crenshaw
[9:00] Exploring the details of the new Taliban rule
[11:45] “I come from the Special Ops community. I also come from the intelligence community. You have to work with shady characters sometimes but this wasn’t one of those cases, this was a time to put your foot down and refuse to let this happen” - Dan Crenshaw
[13:00] Crenshaw talks about all the common-sense failure of the planned withdrawal and the politics that made a reasonable exit impossible
[13:45] “Do you know what ‘slogan’ means? It's from Welsh. It literally  means ‘battle cry of the dead’” - Jordan Peterson
[16:30] The nature of an endless war against the Taliban
[20:45] Life as a US Congressman
[26:25] “The Majority rules absolutely in the House. Nancy Pelosi only has a 4-vote majority and they just kick our buts all the time. We [Republicans] have no power” - Dan Crenshaw
[32:30] Social media in politics
[34:45] “The job of a representative is to explain things [clearly]” - Dan Crenshaw
[37:00] How are conservatives engaging with the youth? What’s the current message?
[50:00] Jordan outlines what he sees and the inherent diversity in the political world as per human psychology
[51:30] “Well, you let these diverse people be free so they can have ideas that might be appropriate for the next problem and then you let them talk, which is why free speech is so important.” - Jordan Peterson
[54:30] The complexity of climate change politics. Capitalism and the free market as testing grounds for what’s actually valuable. Highlighting the anti-capitalist sentiments that seem to come mixed with climate change beliefs, making solutions like nuclear power less likely
[1:03:00] “I'm much more afraid of the people dealing with climate change than of climate change itself” - Jordan Peterson
[1:13:30] “Cheap energy means wealth–directly, with virtually no intermediation” - Jordan Peterson
[1:14:00] Overview of new proposed climate change legislation in the US. Pros and cons of the infrastructure project. How Biden’s economics will hit business in the upcoming years, according to Crenshaw
[1:26:00] On Crenshaw’s book Fortitude: American Resilience in the Era of Outrage

Why I Love Great Britain,2021-12-16T01:19:43Z,PT22M56S,2103623,76420,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/12/14/love-great-britain/

In early December 2021 asked by a major British newspaper to write some words reflecting on my recent two-week visit to the UK. I had been invited, then disinvited, to Cambridge University in 2019, when I had planned and made arrangements to participate in a seminar on the Book of Exodus, to help me prepare a series of public lectures on that story. I was invited back to Cambridge this year, and visited, with my wife, in late November and early December, and I wrote about the experience for The Telegraph, a major UK newspaper. That link is here:

In this episode, philosopher Mohammed Hijab joined me to discuss a wide array of topics, such as the traditionalist interpretation of Islam, its metanarrative, the story of the prophet Muhammad, and some common ground among monotheistic Abrahamic religions.

Mohammed Hijab is an author and philosopher whose main interests lie in political philosophy, philosophy of religion, and comparative religion. He seeks to spread a better understanding of traditionalist Islam while engaging with prominent thinkers and philosophers worldwide.

[00:00] Intro
[01:48] What beliefs and practices are central to Islam?
[04:12] Islam’s unmoved mover argument for God and the universe
[07:30] “Things made of parts... must be contingent on being created by something else, a sorting mechanism [that] doesn’t necessitate [creation itself].” Mohammed Hijab
[08:25] “It is problematic, through the lens of Islam... for there to be a god of a triune nature like [in] Christianity.” MH
[08:58] “Islam does not believe that there’s an element of divinity... in human beings.” MH
[10:09] “The word Islam does not mean peace; it means submission. Islam believes that everything in the universe submits to God.” MH
[10:57] The metanarrative of Islam
[12:12] Mohammed’s view of worship and belief
[12:48] “We believe in... the inherent belief in God implanted in humans.” MH
[15:20] What’s the purpose of belief?
[17:00] The instinct for God arguments vs new atheists
[18:27] The Muslim ideal for worship, compared
[24:36] Muslims and Christians as followers of Jesus Christ
[27:59] How does Dr. Peterson envision the spark of divinity?
[28:25] “The divine spark is embodied virtue... reflective of the highest value, operating at a local scale.” JP
[29:42] How are the attributes of God knowable to a Muslim? The importance of the original version of the Quran
[35:07] “Islam is an evangelizing religion... we want everyone to embrace it.” MH
[35:31] Bridges to Islam
[38:50] “I’m speaking from the perspective of someone who’s a traditionalist Muslim and not a liberal or enlightened Muslim.” MH
[40:47] An abridged story of the prophet Muhammad. The Mecca and Medina periods. Rationalizing the warrior emphasis of many Muslim teachings
[44:10] Muhammad’s warrior traits and Hijab’s interpretation
[49:20] Exploring the terms “warlord” and “defensive wars.”
[50:54] In Hijab’s opinion, what’s the central driving force behind the expansion of Islam?
[52:10] “Islam has the capability of being expansive through war... and of making peace treaties. It does and should do whatever’s in its best interest, just like every country.” MH
[55:39] Against totalitarianism
[58:46] “Evangelising isn’t the same as compelling.” MH
[58:56] “Let the best story win. I would say that the proper mode of conversion is something like a shining example.” JP
[01:00:28] M.Hijab on western misconceptions of Islam
[01:03:20] Other seldom-discussed aspects of Islam
[01:08:53] M.Hijab’s take on the war in Serbia

Fix This: Infrastructure & Environment | Gregg Hurwitz and Rick Geddes | EP 207,2021-12-06T17:14:31Z,PT1H28M13S,218776,5805,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"This episode was recorded on November 9th, 2021.

Jordan Peterson, Gregg Hurwitz, and Rick Geddes meet to discuss the debate surrounding the multi-billion dollar infrastructure bill currently going through the US congress.

Rick Geddes is a professor in the Department of Policy Analysis and Management at Cornell University and a well-recognized expert in American infrastructure policy and development. He has done extensive research on infrastructure, including but not limited to the funding, financing, operation, and maintenance of major projects with a focus on new technologies.

Gregg Hurwitz was today’s co-host. Gregg is a former student of Jordan’s at Harvard. He is now a bestselling scriptwriter, producer, and novelist. In the years leading up to the presidential election, Gregg has been working with an independent team of Hollywood writers, producers, and directors to design a moderate, far-reaching political message for the democratic party.

[00:00] Intro
[00:30] Jordan introduces this week’s guests to discuss the newly-proposed infrastructure legislation (winter '21)—a crucial bill for the American people
[03:28] Geddes gives an overview of infrastructure and his background therein
[07:46] The monumental accomplishment of the US interstate highway system. Could it be built again today?
[11:10] “You've heard the adage that time is money. [That's] certainly the case with infrastructure. When a project gets delayed by the NEPA process for say 5 years, the amount of extra money spent... is enormous, it can sometimes double"" Rick Geddes
[14:42] Gregg Hurwitz highlights the unsophisticated way the media and most politicians are currently handling the infrastructure bill
[16:02] “It seems like we can get very little sane discussion in the media on the role that regulation plays in building a renewing infrastructure"" GH
[16:40] Extra delay and cost in federally funded projects is a regressive tax that hurts the poor and middle class
[22:02] Pressure on the infrastructure bill from climate change. Looking at the evolution of new technologies to improve the efficiency of current infrastructure
[25:49] “If infrastructure development means replacing inefficient use of resources with efficient use of resources, that should be a net gain on the economic side, so it helps poor people, and it should also have environmental benefits"" Dr. Peterson
[26:07] What are our current top infrastructure priorities? What needs to be addressed and fixed ASAP?
[35:31] We need to capitalize more on the utility of combined public and private ventures in infrastructure projects
[52:32] The importance of defining and communicating what a successful infrastructure project looks like
[55:36] Given our systemic problems, how can we give politicians and private firms a positive incentive for meaningful participation?
[01:03:14] You can only focus on so many projects before outsourcing becomes a necessity
[01:12:19] You'd be extremely naive to believe that the people sustaining our infrastructure systems are only in it for personal gain
[01:16:48] The extraordinary reliability of the societal infrastructure system
[01:18:47] “The idea that it's just power that drives people to the top of organizations isn't true because, if it were, we would have many more psychopaths and they would be way more successful"" JP
[01:23:15] What about infrastructure projects that should be started immediately?
[01:25:44] “This is the ultimate bipartisan thing because it will reduce greenhouse gases, diesel emissions, improve the efficiency of our infrastructure, and it's right there on the table"" RG

The Uniting Power of Story | Angus Fletcher | EP 205,2021-11-29T18:35:04Z,PT1H29M54S,181307,5402,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"This episode was recorded on September 7, 2021.

Angus Fletcher and I discuss creativity, the link between literature and resilience, what makes for compelling narratives, the different kinds of stories, and much more.

Angus Fletcher is a Professor of Story Science at Ohio State's Project Narrative, the world's leading academic think-tank for narrative theory. He is also the author of Wonderworks: The 25 Most Important Inventions in the History of Literature.

Find more Angus Fletcher on his website: https://AngusFletcher.co

[00:00] Intro
[01:21] What is Project Narrative?
[02:27] ""Stories are the most powerful things ever invented. They're the most powerful tool we possess"" Angus Fletcher
[03:04] ""When you realize stories have the power to change how our mind works, to troubleshoot it, to make it more resilient, more creative, more scientific—to do all these things... When you couple the power of stories with the human brain, you throw open the doors to anything"" AF
[03:53] The problem with literary studies. How stories empower us and improve performance
[07:06] Wonderworks and the story of courage in Homer's Iliad
[12:40] ""Literature and scripture are synonyms. They mean 'that which is written.' So [something] more fundamental than any technology... Is simply that sense of spiritual experience"" AF
[13:18] The Neuropsychology of Anxiety by J. Grey
[14:44] What are the 2 kinds of stories?
[19:12] Story thinking
[19:22] ""Human cognition is largely narrative. We process the world narratively"" AF
[22:12] ""The wonder of being on this earth... is to build stories and [empower people] to tell their own"" AF ""And to unite us in a collective story so we can work towards the same ends"" JP
[23:00] Why are certain stories so compelling?
[24:48] The zone of proximal development
[25:44] ""Being enthralled is a manifestation of the instinct that specifies the zone of proximal development"" JP
[31:24] The ideal spirit transcending the individual; Jung's Pleroma
[32:14] ""The flip side of anxiety is creativity—they're both about restless energy"" AF
[33:31] What's the source of dreams?
[33:55] ""We have this vast knowledge in embodied action."" A great storyteller takes ""images that reflect a compelling pattern of behavior [and verbalizes them]” JP
[34:56] Abstract representation of patterns as a dream-source
[38:43] Computational power, stories, and the differences between the abstract and particular
[38:48] ""Much of what drives the demand for higher computational resources is... producing artificial realities for fantasy simulation"" JP 
[45:51] Christianity and Star Wars
[46:35] ""Star Wars is Christianity for atheist nerds"" JP
[46:56] ""We are most happy when we don't perceive ourselves as inheriting an archetypal story"" AF
[48:16] ""We see in stories, and this is partly why our eyes are adapted... so that people can see [the white in] our eyes. It's really important because [our eyes point at] what they're interested in. We can see what they value [and] infer their motivation"" JP
[50:36] Literature and psychedelic experiences
[51:27] ""In psychotherapy... you're trying to hammer the person's narrative into a single... functional unit"" JP
[55:31] Trauma, unconscious mapping, and dream analysis
[56:56] ""Any territory you cannot perceive through the overlaid projection of a narrative map is traumatizing"" JP 
[59:59] Jung, Joseph Campbell, and Erich Neumann
[01:02:51] Jung vs Darwin on stories
[01:10:18] ""Literature can build emotional and intellectual resilience"" AF
[01:14:55] Being adaptive is “to be emotionally and intellectually resilient"" AF
[01:15:54] Creative training; measuring creativity

"Meaning, Awe, and the Conceptualization of God (Part 1-3) | EP 202",2021-11-26T21:27:11Z,PT3H7M22S,1228511,19697,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Over the last few weeks, we have put together a series entitled ""Meaning, Awe and the Conceptualization of God"" for the Dr Jordan B Peterson Podcast. This series was built around investigating the various methods and practices that humans use to conceptualize God. This investigation leads us down the path of exploring meaning and awe. Why are we struck by awe when viewing a beautiful painting? Why does walking inside the door of a great Cathedral take our breath away? What is the relationship between these experiences and God? 

This compilation includes all 3 parts, as can be found separately wherever you listen to your audio podcasts!

Featured in this compilation:

 @John Vervaeke  
 @Bishop Robert Barron  
Stephen Blackwood
Roland Griffiths
Iain McGilchrist
Stephen Fry
Randall Wallace
 @Word on Fire Institute  (Christopher Kaczor and Matthew Petrusek)

This series was released in three parts on all audio platforms. The series was popular enough for us to make a video version of the series, and we decided to put them all together in one video.

[00:00] Preview
[01:30] Intro
[02:40] Everyone gives their answer to “What is meaning?”
[03:30] “We're using meaning as a metaphor... something similar to the way a sentence works. It has intelligibility to it that connects us to the world... so that we can interact and be informed by it” Jon Vervaeke
[07:22] “Our mental framing is transparent like a pair of glasses, but there are times we need to step back and, by taking the glasses off and examining them, consider our framing structure"" JV
[09:10] “When you look at the world there is a central point of focus. When you focus on the point with your eyes it becomes very clear... until we no longer perceive anything by the edge of our vision. It's nothingness, it's just not there"" Jordan Peterson
[13:56] Bishop Barron's view on meaning and religion
[14:23] “I would say that meaning is to be in a purposeful relationship to a value"" Bishop Robert Barron
[17:55] “So I'm talking to you, which I believe is a good, but it's nested in a higher good and a still higher good, so finally I want not just this particular good but good itself—that's a religious relationship"" BRB
[18:20] Pageau’s opening thoughts on meaning and religion
[19:56] “The reason we perceive hierarchy is because we are always judging... or trying to evaluate whether something’s good"" Pageau
[20:31] Jordan’s brief foray into “mini-celebrations”
[21:53] The idea of revelation
[24:46] “It isn't obvious to me that we see objects—we see patterns"" JP
[27:40] “Like a Rolling Stone—it wasn't the first song I liked, but it was the first that rocked my world and rearranged my mind, and I think that's where real value is"" BRB
[28:42] Underlying causes of the crisis of meaning
[30:10] “Something that starts with Scotus... and goes into the heart of the scientific revolution is that there’s no such thing as levels—reality just is"" JV
[31:00] Science around the hierarchy of intelligibility and connectedness
[33:00] What is science?
[39:00] “There’s an epistemic hierarchy and science does not belong on the top"" BRB
[42:00] “As scientists, we are motivated by a narrative we don't understand scientifically… The whole enterprise is driven by a dream whose reality can't be encapsulated within the process itself"" JP
[44:00] The ignorance in assuming science OR religion are correct
[44:40] Eminationist ontologies
[55:30] Religious experiences
[01:07:30] The book of Revelations as a psychedelic experience.
[01:17:30] The Psychedelic problem and why psychedelics are useful in communal experiences.
[01:26:00] Jordan’s biblical lectures
[01:32:00] What are the guests working on?
[01:36:00] Beauty in churches
[01:38:00] Growing up Christian
[01:44:00] Possibility is real
[01:50:00] Joining religion and science

A Lecture by Jonathan Pageau: The Symbolic World | EP 206,2021-11-21T00:00:11Z,PT1H56M39S,1004278,27758,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Our friend @JonathanPageau gave a lecture on the conceptual structure of Genesis for an event that was orchestrated by the Montreal Jung Society. Jordan felt that this lecture would serve as a wonderful adjunct to his biblical series, also on Genesis, featured on this channel. 

Thank you to the Montreal Jung Society and Jonathan for letting us release this video on our channel. We hope that you find it useful. Visit sites.google.com/site/cgjungmontreal for more info on the Montreal Jung Society.

Event Title: The Symbolic World - a lecture by Jonathan Pageau

Event Description: “Meaning is showing itself to no longer be an overlay to an arbitrary world of phenomena, but rather the very pattern of reality.
 
Through the questions of emergence, attention and consciousness which have been permeating so many fields in the recent past, the reality of pattern, ritual and image have also come to the fore. Meaning is showing itself, in a burgeoning post-secular age, as no longer only a subjective overlay to an arbitrary world of phenomena, but rather the very pattern of reality itself. In this frame we come to realize that the archetypal truths are not mostly biological and mental constructs in humans; they are firstly the inescapable patterning of the indefinite potential of the world as it encounters intelligence.”

[00:00] Introduction
[02:34] What are hard monetary assets?
[06:13] The argument for bitcoin being the best hard money ever created
[09:11] ""Bitcoin only has users... no admins. There is nobody with a master key"" - Saifedean Ammous
[10:36] How the Bitcoin network functions using ""consensus parameters""
[15:49] ""The way that Bitcoin came about seems... virtually impossible to believe"" - Jordan Peterson
[18:27] Other schools of economics (Austrian) vs. the most common today (Keynesian)
[20:46] ""So the Austrian school of economics... tilts you more towards an appreciation of non-centrally controlled, distributed networks, and emphasis on the individual actor"" - JP
[23:25] Paul Samuelson and communist economic expectations of centralized planning post-WW2
[25:27] Dr. Ammous' academic background
[27:14] Climate change. The push towards central planning, implying certain people or groups know the exact consequences and solutions to future economic developments
[29:41] ""I've been struck by the problem of unintended consequences and the irreducible complexity of things. We can talk about the problem of climate change, but those words are incredibly deceiving"" - JP
[34:16] Highlighting the crucial role of the entrepreneur in Austrian economics
[40:46] Saifedean reflects on the views held by the central bank, governments, and mainstream economists on money—as opposed to Bitcoin's structuring and the Austrian school of thought
[41:43] ""From the Austrian perspective, money is a product of the market and not the invention of the state. The state's meddling in money... is irrational and cannot succeed for the same reasons central planning does not succeed"" - SA
[45:50] Overview of Dr. Ammous' book The Fiat Standard
[54:40] Current inflation in Western democracies. The devastating effect of hyperinflation on the average person
[58:15] ""Money is an incredible technology for lowering our time preference"" - SA

[01:06:39] The Fiat Standard
[01:10:29] Why are we allowing people to mine bitcoin?
[01:12:46] The genius that went into the production of the Bitcoin code
[01:23:14] The crazy reality of decision-making at climate change panels
[01:26:36] Fiat-based currency jobs and the Zoom warriors disconnected from the physical world
[01:31:09] ""A lot of the problems of the 20th century, in my opinion, have their roots in highly inflationary fiat currency"" - SA
[01:31:18] Covering some of the common objections against Bitcoin
[01:39:45] ""We are always going to find more reasons to print money"" - SA

"Islam, Christ, and Liberty | Mustafa Akyol | EP 201",2021-11-08T21:09:08Z,PT1H45M9S,666879,19185,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"This episode was recorded on October 18th 2021.

Mustafa Akyol joins me to discuss Muslim history and tradition. We touch on subjects like Jesus Christ from a Christian and Muslim perspective, the Virgin Mary's role in the Quran, separation of church and state as an ideology, the dangers of literalism when facing religious texts, and much more.

Mustafa Akyol is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute's Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity, where he focuses on the intersection of public policy, Islam, and modernity. He's contributed as an opinion writer for the New York Times since 2013, covering politics and religion in the Muslim world.

Published by W. W. Norton, his 2011 book, ""Islam Without Extremes: A Muslim Case for Liberty,"" presents a strong argument for Islamic liberalism. The book was long-listed for the Lionel Gelber Prize for best nonfiction book. It was also praised by The Financial Times as ""a forthright and elegant Muslim defense of freedom."" His other books include ""Reopening Muslim Minds"" and ""The Islamic Jesus.""

Find Mustafa's most important book, ""Reopening Muslim Minds,"" here

[00:00] Introduction
[02:47] Regarding the separation of church and state, what do Christians and Muslims have in common?
[10:36] What are some similarities between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam?
[11:05] ""I see the world's history, and I see a Judeo-Christian/Islamic history because it's all Abrahamic monotheism starting at Judaism."" Mustafa Akyol
[11:46] What the Three Abrahamic religions have in common—monotheism, rooting in the same tradition; and strange insistence on a book as the bedrock of culture
[12:45] Unique ideas of religious and societal tolerance through different ages in history
[21:10] The connection Jesus and Islam
[28:45] What is the totalitarian impulse?
[29:30] ""I think it is an understatement of the severity of the totalitarian problem to attribute it merely to the religious."" - Jordan Peterson
[31:27] Critiquing the inevitable flaws of the purely secular state. The benefits of a higher law on the unification of people and not deifying human rulers
[34:59] ""There is another value in Sharia law—[it] was separate from the rulers, even above the rulers."" - Mustafa Akyol
[39:35] Briefly touching on the ruling class in Saudi Arabia. A brief history of the Wahhabi's rise to power, and how a group of extreme thinkers gained more power than would have been naturally possible
[45:36] Bad Ideas from the West are, in fact, devastating
[48:45] A modern Muslim's take on religion, power, and the birth of Islam with the prophet Muhammad
[55:15] ""The whole thorny moral problem of what to do when you are being oppressed is not something let's say as a species we have figured out."" - JBP
[01:01:32] What is Mustafa's goal in studying Islam?
[01:06:49] A study of how God's commandments are delivered as a teacher or legislator
[01:18:51] ""The inherent problem with literalism in interpretation. The perspective of the reader creates so much of the truth in this model that they can then impose on the world around them."" - JBP
[01:26:20] Regarding reason and Sharia law, one group has said that Sharia indicates what's inherently right and wrong in the world. Another group, that it only creates that difference through the imposition
[01:27:01] Mary's role in the Quran and Islamic tradition
[01:31:29] The influence of gnostic Christian gospels on Muhammad in Mustafa's opinion. The odd state of the Jewish Christians who were accepted by neither side
[01:35:16] Final questions on Jesus Christ from Christian and Muslim perspectives
[01:43:35] Wrapping up

A Wing and a Prayer,2021-11-02T20:12:32Z,PT5M50S,1158968,114961,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"A wing and a prayer
or 
the enemy
(this has to stop)

God lift me from the intolerable burden of my ignorance, arrogance, wilful blindness, bitterness and resentment

As I pray that others rise above the same faults and temptations

I watched Fox News release a message this week:

There are terrible things afoot under the surface of our society, and the perpetrators are coming for you

And coming for us

And then I watched the Democrats respond in panic and anger, saying:

There are terrible things afoot under the surface of our society, and the perpetrators are coming for you

And coming for us

Are there terrible things afoot, bubbling under the surface? 
Is something coming for you?
And for us?

Ask yourself how true that is of yourself and your own life

Have you addressed all that? 

Are you concerning yourself with the dust in your enemy’s eyes, instead of attending to the filth that obscures your own sight?

Do we want accusation, suspicion, discord, derision and hatred? 

Or the peace and prosperity and happiness that beckons to us at this moment like never before?

Who’s the enemy here?

Is it the basket of deplorables?
Is it the freaks and the queers?

Is it the plumbers and carpenters and tradesmen and managers who work honestly and diligently during the day and the soldiers who stalwartly defend the borders and protect us?

Is it the artists and visionaries whose expressions of unbridled creativity entertain and rejuvenate us and who continually offer to us an unending panoply of technological miracle?

Is it the institutions that guide and protect us that so many lived and died to erect and establish which for all their faults have served us so well?

Do we want revenge or justice?
Do we want contempt or mercy?
Do we want war—or peace?

And what are you aiming at in your heart of hearts?

I see even the best of men degenerating into the exchange of blows. 
I see even the best of men identifying the enemy in our neighbours and friends.
I see even the best of men falling prey to cowardice and self-righteous anger.

It needs to stop. 
I need to stop.
You need to stop.

Before it’s too late.

Who is the enemy here?

The snake in your heart?
The lies on your tongue?
The arrogance of your intellect?
The cowardice of our refusal to see?

The enemy is that which divides to sow discord.

The enemy is the pride and fear that stops us from lending a hand acoss the divide.

The enemy is the great and eternal adversary of mankind.

And if we demonize our brothers, our comrades-in-arms, do we not precisely call that dread spirit forth?

Have we not yet learned?

Courage
Trust
Truth
Love

Even unto your enemy. 
Which is you.

God forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us
May what is highest guide our vision
May what is highest open our ears
May what is highest guide our tongues

And may we pray
Fearful of the hell we could so easily and carelessly create

Deliver us from evil
Shine a light into the corners of our dark hearts

For thine is the Kingdom
The Power and the Glory
For Ever and Ever

Amen

Dr. Clay Routledge is an existential psychologist, writer, and professor at North Dakota State University. He's also a senior research fellow at the Archbridge Institute and an editor for Profectus magazine. Dr. Routledge studies basic psychological needs and how they're shaped by family, social bonds, economics, and broader cultural worldviews. He has published over 100 scholarly papers, co-edited three books on existential psychology, and written several books, including Nostalgia: A Psychological Resource, Supernatural: Death, Meaning, and the Power of the Invisible World. 

A lot of Dr. Routledge’s work - like Dr. Peterson's - focuses on the need for meaning. The two had a wide-ranging conversation about loneliness, meaning, nostalgia, Terror Management Theory, and existential psychology. They also shared views on human progress, responsibility, religion, and UFOs.

The End of Universities? | EP 185,2021-08-02T18:48:02Z,PT42M26S,630501,28721,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Yeonmi Park's account of her experience at Columbia University is harrowing - as someone who had just arrived in the West after her escape from North Korea, the idea that she had to censor herself at a prestigious university like Columbia, or any university for that matter -  which have historically been bastions of free thought is horrifying. Her experience serves as one example of just how far the Universities have deteriorated.

#Universities #UofColumbia #ColumbiaUniversity

Dr Peterson wanted to put this together because he still feels like it’s possible to save the Universities, but before that can happen, more people need to be aware of just how twisted they’ve become. Feel free to share and reference this video as some evidence and perspectives on the state of Western Universities.

Jordan Peterson’s guest today is distinguished Professor Emeritus at the University of New Mexico, American entomologist and evolutionary biologist, Dr. Randy Thornhill.

Dr. Thornhill’s research shines an enticing light on scientific areas that most people have never been exposed to. We come to understand and appreciate the importance of evolutionary biology in shaping our opinions, attitudes, and in many cases the decisions we make throughout our lives. Dr. Thornhill has authored and co-authored around 250 scientific publications, and a majority of his work has been cited in scientific literature over 35,000 times.

Dr. Thornhill shares his findings on attractiveness including cryptic female choice, symmetry, carotenoid pigments, and the characteristics of attractiveness. They also cover Dr. Thornhill’s parasite-stress theory, the critical role that infectious disease plays in humanity, IQ, sex, religion, and conservatism.

On this episode of the Jordan Peterson Podcast, Jordan is accompanied by American-Canadian theoretical physicist and cosmologist Lawrence M. Krauss. Throughout his career, Dr. Krauss has made remarkable contributions to the field of research on particle physics and cosmology. Dr. Krauss formerly worked at Yale University, Case Western Reserve University, and Arizona State University. Dr. Krauss also founded ASU’s Origins Project, a non-profit corporation that holds public panel discussions on science, culture, and social issues. Some of his work includes popular books such as The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe from Nothing.

Jordan and Lawrence sit down to discuss a variety of topics in the mind-boggling world of quantum physics. They spend time discussing generated models of the beginning of our universe, the lawbreaking complexities of quantum physics, the ramifications related to entropy, the usefulness of the scientific method, as well as the instinctive behaviour for religious compulsion among human beings.

__________________

[00:00] Introduction.
[2:00] Jordan kicks things off by positing a description of entropy for discussion relating to complexity in systems of matter, time, and energy.
[13:00] Krauss expounds on the value of overcoming failure.
[16:00] Peterson prompts Krauss to expand on times in his career where the redirection of an experiment led to incredible discovery that was not related to his original intention or hypothesis.
[21:30] The science of cosmology, taking the listeners back to the beginning of our universe through theoretical models.
[27:00] The size of the universe, is it a reasonable question to ask?
[41:00] Exploring the concept of time relative to change, space, and matter.
[44:30] Talking about the creation of the universe looking at matter versus antimatter distribution.
[56:00] The current picture (based on models of the matter and antimatter at the beginning of the universe).
[1:01:00] The ability of the laws of physics to fluctuate at different energy levels (scale, size). The formation of all the foundational elements in existence.
[1:10:00] Quantum fluctuation, quantum mechanics, quantum ground state, the resonant wavelength of electrons, and much more.
[1:20:30] Lawrence Krauss gives his summarization of the interpretation of quantum mechanics and complexity.
[1:25:30] Debating meaning, truth, reality, and reason in the universe. The complex and strained relationship between the scientific method and religious instinct towards our existence.
[1:43:00] Jordan asks Lawrence to comment on the religious instinct removed by modern atheists popping up again in a politicalized form of secular humanism.

[00:00] Intro
[0:18] Jordan introduces this episode’s guest journalist and writer Bari Weiss
[2:00] Starting off with Bari's journey leading up to working for the New York Times. The original goal of her position at the Times was to provide a unique perspective through opinion pieces that wouldn't normally be on the radar of a typical Times reader or writer
[6:00] Weiss writing career starting with the Wallstreet Journal before moving onto the Times
[8:00] Jordan does a small divergence into the undergraduate experience in modern elite universities, specifically in the humanities. Bari speaks on her experience with politically directed curriculum
[22:30] Weiss connects the experience of modern universities as her first exposure to an ideal of neo-racism that would cause her future actions as a journalist
[30:30] A closer examination of the phrase ""Systemic Racism"" and what it typically implies for those that use it in western culture
[44:30] Weiss talks about the beginning of her experience writing and editing at the Times. She was always the odd one out with her opinions and faced 
[55:30] Examining the attractive attributes of accepting the system of ideas associated with new systemic racism ideology. The thin veneer of society and the illogical drive to tear down what seems to be bringing the most benefit of any time in history to the poor and disadvantaged
[1:10:00] Jordan critiques the flaw with the new atheist’s destruction of religion. People need something in their lives that is some sort of romantic adventure in their eyes
[1:15:30] Going back to the Times. What type of journalist/editor was Weiss trying to be?
[1:24:00] The danger of keeping quiet instead of speaking up when it's absolutely paramount to do so
[1:34:30] What was the final turn of events that led Bari to see the Time as a place she could no longer work in good faith?
[1:40:00] Jordan asks Weiss to comment on the generational divide he sees, should a corporation be a moral actor?
[1:44:00] The fallout from the Tom Cotton article on bringing in the national guard during riots in 2020
[1:51:00] The temptation of writing ""heroin"" for your readers or listeners. The cost of telling the truth and the increased cost for young unestablished people is concerning
[2:05:00] Establishing the idea of Judgement as a necessity. How do you foster the next generation to think critically and become a good mentor instead of a tyrant to a younger mentee?
[2:14:00] Jordan asks Bari what her plans are for the future with substack and writing/editing
[2:21:30] Wrapping up the show. Where can you find more Bari Weiss online

“I feel like my generation is mad at the younger generation like we look at them like their idiots, and their soft, and their sensitive but the problem with that is we made that generation, that generation was inside of us and we released it.”

On this episode, Jordan joins the show to co-host this episode with Russell Peters, a Canadian comedian, actor, and producer.

Together, they explore politically incorrect humour, stand up, acting, travel, working during the pandemic, universally funny truths, spontaneous action, the personality of a comedian, and more. Russell is hilarious and we had a great time.

He is perhaps best known for writing the historical drama Braveheart (1995), which earned him a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay and an Academy Award nomination in the same category, but has since directed The Man in the Iron Mask (1998), We Were Soldiers (2002), Secretariat (2010) and Heaven Is for Real (2014). Mr. Wallace also penned the lyrics to the acclaimed hymn Mansions of the Lord (music by Nick Glennie-Smith), featured in the soundtrack of When We Were Soldiers, and performed as the recessional for President Ronald Reagan's funeral. 

Mr. Wallace and I discussed the power of art, music, and story, his unlikely stint writing songs for an animal band, the profound influence of Biblical stories on his work and thought, the experience of depression, the necessity and significance of sacrifice, the general development of his career as a successful Hollywood writer and director, and his upcoming action movie about the Pope.

This episode was recorded on April 22nd, 2021

Paul Rossi and I discuss the controversy surrounding a recent article Paul wrote. It has become apparent that an anti-racism curriculum is being instituted in schools across the United States and that doesn’t initially sound like anything but a positive change. I had Paul on to share his concerns after working in one of these schools that are implementing new ways of thinking about how our western society is structured. We spoke about many of the flaws that we see with the current direction of teaching.

Paul Rossi is a high school mathematics teacher and writer. His April 21st, 2021 essay titled “I Refuse to Stand by While my Students are Indoctrinated” was published on Bari Weiss’ Substack “Common Sense with Bari Weiss”.

Jordan Peterson's Critique of the Communist Manifesto,2021-04-17T23:09:10Z,PT29M41S,2399778,92551,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"On February, April 19, 2019, I debated Marxist philosopher Slavoj Zizek in Toronto, April 19 at the Sony Centre. I started with a critique of The Communist Manifesto, which is the central revolutionary document of the Marxist movement. 

Dr. Zizek is a Slovenian philosopher and professor at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, whose works on cultural studies, psychoanalysis, and, above all, for the purposes of our debate, Marxism, are world-renowned. The topic? Happiness: Marxism vs Capitalism.

A good article, I think, on Zizek: https://www.iep.utm.edu/zizek/#H2

The Development of the Individual Requires Sacrifice | Russell Brand & Mikhaila & Jordan Peterson,2021-03-29T18:40:07Z,PT15M32S,456939,16789,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"To watch the full episode: https://youtu.be/ISHmPXOS_Og @Mikhaila Peterson 

As a special treat for our fans, Russell added the option for a free of month of his subscription platform Luminary. Visit luminary.link/mp to start your trial.

The process of maturation requires multiple levels of sacrifice, including what some would call the ultimate sacrifice, putting another's needs in front of your own. This is the role of the parent to the child, the mentor to the protege, and in Christian terms - Christ to the Believer. 

Often, people think of the act of sacrifice in terms of loss, but it is just as valid to think of sacrifice as a necessary vehicle to future gain. Without sacrifice, it would seem that the individual is incentivized to search for nothing more than impulsive pleasures with short-term gain and long-term consequence as a result.

What have you sacrificed for the people you love? Having seen the result of your sacrifice, would you trade that sacrifice for short-term pleasure-seeking behavior?

Imitation as a Gateway to Development | Russell Brand & Mikhaila & Jordan Peterson,2021-03-28T18:34:54Z,PT1M43S,173475,8819,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"To watch the full episode: https://youtu.be/ISHmPXOS_Og @mikhaila 

If you want to improve yourself, you might look to someone you admire and imitate them. You'll pull yourself towards them by the process of imitation.

You might think comparing yourself to someone is different than imitating, but imitating and comparing are the same thing. When you compare yourself to someone, you start pulling yourself towards them. You have to be careful you don't get envious or resentful. In some sense, by continually imitating somebody at a higher level, you're always unfulfilled. In another sense, that means you're always growing. 

Jung believed the book of Revelations had been tacked onto the New Testament because the Christ in the gospels was portrayed too much as a figure of mercy. Whereas, in Revelations, Christ is portrayed primarily as a judge. Jung’s explanation was that every ideal is a judge. The ultimate ideal is the ultimate judge. The ultimate ideal judges your soul. The higher the ideal, the more severe the judge. That should make you quake. When your conscience assaults you in the middle of the night for things you’ve done wrong, it’s because you’re quaking in your boots, morally, because you’ve failed to live up to this ideal.

Here is the transcript of the interviews: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/blog-posts/sunday-times-unedited-interview-transcript/

Here are the full unedited audio recordings of the interviews my daughter @mikhaila and I recently undertook with Decca Aitkenhead of the Times -https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/jordan-peterson-depression-drug-dependency-daughter-mikhaila-rehab-russia-0xtz2ph32

Here’s a way to get access to the article for free: https://join.thetimes.co.uk/?pc=regacc&ILC=INT-TNL_Header_text_181017&gotoUrl=

We have decided to release the audio recording of the interviews public to ensure that people have access to the full story. We didn't record video this time.

I agreed to the interview in the hopes of having questions about my health over the past two years addressed by a reliable media once and for all before the release of my new book Beyond Order in March. This was done partly at my publisher's request.

Mikhaila fielded the initial questions to help reduce the stress I experience in recounting the events in question. She also remembers more of what happened. She was also part of my interview at my request to ensure it didn’t continue for too long and to make sure that I didn't get excessively fatigued.

Mikhaila suggested we put my interview first as this is addressed to my audience, although my interview took place the day after hers. Her interview starts at 1:26:30.

Show Notes:
[1:00] Jordan Peterson kicks off the conversation by asking why and how Matthew McConaughey wrote his book Greenlights.
[4:00] Matthew realized he needed to write the book himself without a ghostwriter as initially planned and dig back into his journals as a form of necessary reflection on the past.
[6:00] Matthew’s old journals revealed their common thread through all the stories, poems, and bumper stickers. That common thread was the creation of good things in life through mindset or action “Greenlights.”
[12:00] Jordan talks about his initial response after reading Matthew’s book and how his expectations were changed.
[14:00] Matthew talks about his solo trips when starting to create the structure of his book. Jordan comments that this was a book written by a celebrity that did not really focus on the traditional parts of being a celebrity (very family-focused and foundational). Matthew states, “When we were editing the book, I found that the more personal the stories became, the more relatable they seemed to become, to the human condition, and that was my hope.”
[18:00] Jordan and Matthew revisit the African trip, chasing dreams and having the same exact dream multiple times over the span of many years.
[24:00] What was the personal impact on Matthew during his trip to Africa where he got to strip away the identity we all know him for and exist as something else? Jordan comments that very often, people confuse their reputation with who they really are, and they start to act as a representation of their reputation instead of themselves; it’s an easy trap to fall into.
[22:00] Matthew discusses dealing with the pitfalls of fame. Matthew covers his changing relationship with his mother due to success.
[25:00] Jordan B. Peterson asks Matthew McConaughey about some of his acting work in True Detective and playing dark characters. “How do you play a dark role very well without letting the darkness invade you?”
[32:00] Matthew talks about the positive aspects of the sometimes tense relationship with his father and having a childhood that balanced love and hardship directed from the same people.
[37:00] Jordan and Matthew continue talking about going deeper into the psychology of a dark character like Rustin Cole on True Detective
[45:30] Matthew expanded on the short-term effects of initial fame.
[51:30] Matthew and Jordan discuss the long-term effects of fame. 
[55:00] Jordan points out, “If flawed people were incapable of creativity, we would have no creativity.”
[1:03:00] How Matthew and Jordan first became friends.
[1:07:30] Matthew shares a comical review of his own book written as if Jordan was the one reviewing it.

Recorded in early September. For those international viewers, unfamiliar with Canadian media, it will be useful for you to know that Rex Murphy is one of Canada's premier journalists: tough, truthful, politically correct, and possessed of a singular style and character. It was both an honor and a pleasure to meet him. I highly recommend his channel. Podcast available at http://bit.ly/RexJordan

Q & A: The Meaning and Reality of Individual Sovereignty,2019-08-03T17:20:56Z,PT20M2S,333482,10288,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"On May 2, 2019, in San Francisco, I spoke to the Independent Institute on ""The Meaning and Reality of Individual Sovereignty"" (available for viewing here: http://bit.ly/2LKeljL). This Q & A was held later in the afternoon, allowing more audience members to participate in the discussion.

Why has the idea of individual sovereignty been granted such primacy of place in free Western societies? Why were the men who formulated the Declaration of Independence willing to declare:  “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness,"" and, further, to insist ""That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.""

Why, as well, are ideas of individual sovereignty, which have proved so successful in guaranteeing freedom and prosperity in the West and, increasingly, around the world, under attack, by those on the left and the right who offer collective identity as an alternative?

I'm introduced by Independent President David J. Theroux. My comments are followed by a conversation with Independent Institute Senior Vice President Mary L.G. Theroux and Executive Director Graham Walker.

A public Q and A session was held a little later in the afternoon, and is available here: http://bit.ly/2HkhuUm

Religious Belief and the Enlightenment with Ben Shapiro,2019-07-21T14:10:09Z,PT1H10M12S,650387,16531,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Podcast available at http://bit.ly/2JU3e5g

Ben Shapiro really needs no introduction, given that he is now one of the most recognized individuals on the American political/journalism scene. In any case, he is an American lawyer, writer, journalist and political commentator. He has written ten books, the latest of which is The Right Side of History: How Reason and Moral Purpose Made the West Great. 
It (see Harper Collins Publishers at http://bit.ly/2xGzxPg and Amazon.com at https://amzn.to/2XHcS4L). 

He became the youngest nationally syndicated columnist in the US at age 17. He’s one of the most recognized current commentator on the new media, YouTube and Podcasts. He serves as editor in chief for the Daily Wire (https://www.dailywire.com/), which he founded, and is the host of the Ben Shapiro Show, which runs daily on podcast and radio. It can be found, for example, on Soundcloud at https://soundcloud.com/benshapiroshow

Sean Plunket: Full Interview: New Zealand,2019-07-07T19:55:00Z,PT42M47S,215148,7518,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"I'm afraid that I am somewhat behind with my YouTube postings, as I am dealing with very serious health issues with my wife, and the distress and complication associated with that has brought me to somewhat of a halt. This is an interview from New Zealand from a couple of months ago. I think it's still relevant. I hope it's still relevant. 

The interviewer, Sean Plunkett, is one of New Zealand's more credible journalists, in my estimation. He's received the Qantas Media Awards in radio and television categories, the New Zealand Radio Awards and the 2001 European Union Journalist Award.

Podcast: Who is Joe Rogan? With Jordan Peterson,2019-06-16T16:53:03Z,PT2H39M34S,3339962,73464,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3KrWbS8

Joe Rogan needs little introduction. Host of what is perhaps the most widely known podcast in the world, the Joe Rogan Experience, he is also a former martial arts champion, a TV star (Hardball and News Radio, Fear Factor), a UFC commentator, and an exceptionally successful standup comedian, with several Netflix specials under his belt, as well as numerous comedy CDs.  

He's a very effective and engaing interviewer. He asks tough questions. He has his own point of view. But he listens, and he treats his audience with respect. They return the favor, with hundreds of millions downloading his podcast and watching the Joe Rogan Experience on YouTube (http://bit.ly/2XmYcXP) with more than 5.5 million subscribers. 

He's been a great friend to me.

On Claiming Belief In God: Discussion with Dennis Prager,2019-06-09T06:25:47Z,PT53M28S,1969557,53514,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"I talked with Dennis Prager at the Prager Summit in May in Santa Barbara. It's really a discussion about two previous talks, for a collection of three. I would recommend watching them in the following order: 

First, watch Who Dares Say He Believes in God? (https://youtu.be/MnUfXYGtT5Q). That lecture was part of my 12 Rules for Life tour, and took place in Sydney, Australia, Feb 26, 2019. 

Second, watch the lecture I gave just before this discussion at the  Prager summit: On Claiming Belief in God: Commentary (https://youtu.be/vwKCK5EhibM),.

Then watch this discussion. 

The three presentations will make the most sense in that order, which is why I placed them in the same playlist, On (My) Belief in God: http://bit.ly/2I6g0hq

This discussion is also available at the PragerU YouTube Video Channel at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L47oJxwp6yg. Thanks to Prager U for the invitation and opportunity.

After that lecture, and then this commentary, you could watch the discussion I had with Dennis Prager at the same event (https://youtu.be/j0GL_4cAkhI).

Lecture: Who Dares Say He Believes in God?,2019-06-08T17:40:53Z,PT1H43M33S,4839857,104576,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God. (Mark 10:18; see also Luke 18:19).

Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. (Matthew 7:21, KJV). 

I have been asked many times by many people if I believe in God. I don't like this question. I generally respond by stating that I act as if God exists, but that's not sufficiently true. Who could do that? Who could conduct themselves with the moral exactitude and care necessary of someone who would dare to make that claim? Either claim? In any case, after being asked the question yet again, when I was in Australia, I decided to attempt to answer it in some detail. 

This lecture, one of the 12 Rules for Life tour talks, was delivered in Sydney Feb 26, 2019, at the International Convention Centre. It was one of six I had professionally video recorded. Five of the six will be released directly on thinkspot, our new social media platform (to be announced in mid-June), as a bonus for direct subscribers (not to worry; there are still more than 50 to be released as audio on the Jordan B Peterson podcast at http://bit.ly/2HUdgnc, so it's not as if there will be any shortage). But I thought YouTube would be appropriate for this, given the potentially broad interest in the topic.

I've made a new playlist for it, too, entitled On (my) Belief in God. Three videos make up that playlist:  this one, a 20 minute talk I did for the Prager summit in May of 2019 (https://youtu.be/vwKCK5EhibM), and an interview/discussion I had with Dennis Prager at the same event (https://youtu.be/j0GL_4cAkhI)

 I would recommend watching them in the playlist order, which will be this lecture first, then my Prager talk, then the interview, if you're interested in doing so. I think they make a good group.The idea of belief in God is of extreme importance. I hope that these lectures and interviews add to everyone's understanding of my position and why I hold it.

As always, thank you very much for your continued support. 

The adjunct videos are also available on the Prager U site: the lecture at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avInTfCd92Q; the interview at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L47oJxwp6yg

Thanks to the Prager U organization for the invitation and opportunity.

Stephen Hicks: Postmodernism: Reprise,2019-05-27T20:32:24Z,PT1H39M8S,266833,7590,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Podcast available at (http://bit.ly/2JfN08t). 

I last spoke to Dr. Stephen R. C. Hicks (www.stephenhicks.org), Professor of Philosophy at Rockford University, Illinois, USA, Executive Director of the Center for Ethics and Entrepreneurship, and Senior Scholar at The Atlas Society in August of 2017 (http://bit.ly/306ggDQ), and decided that it was time for an update. Dr. Hicks received his Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees from the University of Guelph, Canada, and his Ph.D. in philosophy from Indiana University, Bloomington, USA. He has published four books, translated into sixteen different languages:

• In 1994; 2nd ed 1998 The Art of Reasoning: Readings for Logical Analysis (co-edited with David Kelley, W. W. Norton & Co., 1994, second edition 1998).
• In 2010, Nietzsche and the Nazis 
• In 2016, Entrepreneurial Living (co-edited with Jennifer Harrolle)

The remaining book, published in 2004 and expanded in 2011, Explaining Postmodernism: Skepticism and Socialism from Rousseau to Foucault, has been particularly relevant to our discussions. It’s available at Amazon.com (https://amzn.to/2Jh4Uro) but also in pdf form on Dr. Hick’s website (http://bit.ly/2MaI9rH). I found it very helpful when trying to understand the intellectual roots of the ideas that appear so dominant in today’s universities.

Marxism: Zizek/Peterson:  Official Video,2019-05-15T15:27:15Z,PT2H45M33S,4490725,90032,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"I posted this yesterday, but the volume was too low, so now it's been raised.

On February, April 19, 2019, I debated Marxist philosopher Slavoj Zizek in Toronto, April 19 at the Sony Centre. Dr. Zizek is a Slovenian philosopher and professor at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, whose works on cultural studies, psychoanalysis and, above all, for the purposes of our debate, Marxism, are world-renowned. The topic? Happiness: Marxism vs Capitalism. This is the official video. Many bootlegs have already been released, but that seems inevitable given our current state of technological capability. 

I started with a critique of The Communist Manifesto, which is the central revolutionary document of the Marxist movement (rather than addressing, say, Zizek's work, which wasn't what the debate was about). 

It wasn't so obvious for the rest of the discussion that Marxism, per se, comprised the central topic of discussion.

Watch for yourself.

A good article, I think, on Zizek: https://www.iep.utm.edu/zizek/#H2

I was lecturing about the topics covered in my book, 12 Rules for Life (and also Maps of Meaning, my first book). I had a number of the lectures professionally filmed.  This is a highlight from my lecture in Auckland on the fundamental necessity of the presumption of innocence.

JB Peterson and Akira the Don: Meaningwave/Lofi,2019-05-10T14:29:48Z,PT1H53M53S,156699,5868,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Podcast version at: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/a-conversation-with-akira-the-don/

Akira the Don is a British musician, DJ and producer. He’s worked in genres as diverse as pop, hip-hop, indie, dance, and more recently, perhaps, something that has come to be known as Lofi. 

For reasons that have been quite surprising to me, Akira has been making lowfi tracks, also known as meaningwave, a combination of metred spoken word and music chosen for its emotional and conceptual appropriateness,  from some of my saying and my talks. They been reasonably well-listened to (although I am not sure of the standards of such things), garnering maybe a million views over the 10 or 15 or so that he has posted. The two main albums, 12 Rules for Life and JBP Wave Genesis, have elicited more than million streams each on Spotify (and that doesn’t include iTunes and other content providers of the same type). 

The third album oriented around my words is entitled JBP Wave: Paradise. It was released in April of 2019. Earlier that month, Akira also released a long single, 42 Rules for Life, based on the totality of the rules I had written for Quora several years ago.  

Akira has also produced similar works featuring Alan Watts, Jocko Willink (who is currently number one in the meaningwave tracks), Terrence McKenna, David Foster Wallace and Elon Musk, among others. Overall, Spotify downloads have topped 4 million, with an approximate exposure of a million. 

Akira the Don can be found on YouTube at http://bit.ly/2VVHOMX

Genevieve Wood and I discussed reasons for the apparently increasing attractiveness of socialist ideas in America and the (countervailing) importance and meaningful of personal responsibility, as well as considering why communicating that import appears to be appealing to such a large number of people. 

You can also listen to the interview on The Heritage Events Podcast (http://bit.ly/2UQokcM).  And, you can read what Heritage president Kay Coles James has to say to the younger generation about socialism here: https://herit.ag/2GxxbXc

The full program, which includes an address by the Heritage Foundation President Kay Cole James is available here at the Heritage Foundation YouTube Channel: http://bit.ly/2VhTvNF (as is the lecture that I am posting here, on my channel, now).

April 2019 Q and A,2019-04-19T01:45:38Z,PT1H32M20S,354376,9911,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Tomorrow, I will be debating the renowned Marxist philosopher Slavoj Zizek (https://www.iep.utm.edu/zizek/) at the Sony Centre in Toronto at 7:30 PM on the topic: Happiness: Capitalism vs Marxism. We have decided to livestream this event, for those who might be interested in watching events unfold as they happen. Tickets for the livestream are available at https://www.jordanvsslavojdebate.com/ and also enable the debate to be viewed any time up to 30 days after purchase.  We will also place the debate, in its entirety, on YouTube after a month. 

I’d also like to let you know that Season 2 of the Jordan B Peterson Podcast has now started, with the first three episodes up: two 12 Rules for Life lectures, one from Seattle and one from Portland, as well as an interview with General Stanley McChrystal, retired four star general and former commander of the International Security Assistance Force and Commander, US Forces, Afghanistan. We have partnered with Westwood One (https://www.westwoodone.com), the largest audio network in the US. My daughter Mikhaila (https://mikhailapeterson.com/) is serving as co-host. This means, we hope, higher production quality, weekly delivery, and a broader reach for the podcast, which will now also be ad-supported. Jordan Peterson Videos on YouTube, which will also feature most of the podcast content, will remain unmonetized, as previously.

I am going to London in May to celebrate and promote the release of the May 2 standard Penguin paperback of 12 Rules for Life into the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Indian and other international English markets (not including the US and Canada as of yet). Pre-orders of that paperback can be obtained at the Penguin website here: http://bit.ly/2ItAuRH  I’m very excited to join the great back catalog of Penguin paperbacks, which I have always loved. I’m also attending an academic conference on free speech at Oxford while in England, and subjecting myself with some trepidation to the UK press. 

Finally, I wanted to tell you about https://www.selfauthoring.com/ and https://www.understandmyself.com/ The first is a series of writing programs that helps people understand their past, present and future selves. The second is a personality test based on the Big Five (extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness, as well as the ten aspects that provide that test with higher-resolution results). We are offering a 20% discount on both the 2 for 1 sale at selfauthoring and understandmyself.

Discount Code: MAY

for understandmyself, enter code here:

I might also mention, finally (a lot of news this week) that I was in New York on Monday, taping 16 interviews with Dr. Oz on every topic under the sun related to my work. Some of those will be aired directly on his network show. The others will be released soon on YouTube and other social media. 

So that’s it.

We Make Stories Out of Totem Poles,2019-04-10T13:31:02Z,PT8M26S,113861,7361,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"This is a short film about my friend and honorary brother, Kwakwaka'wakw carver Charles Joseph, who carves his dreams (and sometimes his nightmares) into cedar. 

Charles survived a particularly brutal residential school in Canada and, years later, is still repairing the damage that caused to him. His greatest carving, a 53 foot totem pole that now sits in front of the Montreal Museum of Fine Art (see http://bit.ly/2IqLnU7), is part of the process of that repair, aided by his engagement in the unique, beautiful and profound art of his tradition. 

A few years ago, Charles helped me design a new third floor for my house in Toronto. We installed a number of custom totem poles and carvings on that floor, which was also a modernized version of a Kwakwaka'wakw communal big house. I used barn wood from my great-grandfather's original barn from the original Peterson homestead in Saskatchewan for the walls. It's a unique space (which I have been away from so much, given all my traveling in the last year) and it was a very engaging joint project. I learned a lot from the entire experience (which included a potlatch in Port Hardy, in the northern part of Vancouver Island). 

I am happy to report that most of the terrible dreams and memories that have plagued Charles for so many years have disappeared. 
 
Director Patricia Marcoccia's Toronto-based production company Holding Space Films is currently producing a feature-length documentary film that follows our friendship.

"Jamil Jivani: Author of ""Why Young Men""",2019-03-27T22:12:34Z,PT1H28M22S,196282,7108,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Mr. Jamil Jivani is a Yale Law School graduate who rose out of the depths of a history of extreme academic underachievement to the pinnacles of educational success. He was born in Toronto, and attended Humber College, and York University, prior to enrolling at Yale, where he was Program Director of the Marshal-Brennan Constitutional Literacy Program and President of the Yale Black Law Students Association.  In 2014-2015, he was an articling student at the major Toronto law firm Torys LLP. 

He has also worked diligently in Toronto to improve police-community relationships, as well as holding teaching and research positions at Osgoode Hall Law School and Yale Law School.

Mr. Jivani is, in my opinion, a textbook case of a man who took responsibility. He came from a rough background, certainly one of comparative deprivation, and made far more of the opportunities that were still hidden there in some sense than might be reasonably expected of any man. 

It seems to me that a world that had more people like Jamil Jivani in it would by anyone's standards be a better place.It was a privilege to speak with him. I hope you enjoy the conversation, and I would encourage you to pick up his book, ""Why Young Men: Rage, Race and the Crisis of Identity."" You can get the book in Canada at Amazon.ca here: https://amzn.to/2UiPI24

You can pre-order the US version, due May 21, 2019 in the US at MacMillan at http://bit.ly/2HKqNPg

I should also point out that Mr. Jivani has managed many of his remarkable achievements while suffering from a very serious illness, which we also discuss in this podcast. 




His website can be found at https://www.jamiljivani.ca/

His podcast, The Road Home with Jamil Jivani, is available at Spotify at https://spoti.fi/2UcgpWq, at iTunes at https://goo.gl/V2FALA, as well as on the many other podcast apps popularly and commonly available.

Commentaries on JB Peterson: Rebel Wisdom,2019-03-03T15:11:54Z,PT34M32S,179366,5082,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Rebel Wisdom (http://bit.ly/2T9ZnbD) has compiled a set of clips regarding my work from many of their interviewees, including Iain McGilchrist, Bret Weinstein, Jordan Greenhall, Akira the Don, Jamie Wheal, Tim Lott, Matthew Segall and Jesse Estrin, Doshin Nelson Roshi, Warren Farrell and Gabor Mate.

The original upload can be found here: http://bit.ly/2SFIYqm

From their website: ""In these times of change, we can no longer trust the traditional media to make sense of the world. The old gatekeepers are losing their power. A new counter culture is filling the void, driven by a great intellectual awakening. Facilitated by new technology, it’s made a new kind of conversation possible; more in-depth, more open and more democratic. Fuelled by social media, many have become trapped in reaction and ideology, yet big questions can only be explored with open-minded, self-reflective, grounded conversations.""

Jordan Peterson Threatens Everything of Value In NZ,2019-02-15T05:59:24Z,PT1H3M,820191,29287,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"A couple of days ago (Feb 12, 2019) a group calling itself the Auckland Peace Action, objecting to my slated arrival in New Zealand in a couple of days (www.jordanbpeterson.com/events/) for my 12 Rules for Life Tour, produced a “press release” claiming that “Jordan Peterson Threatens Everything of Value in Our Society.” I thought that was a bit of an overstatement and so, apparently, did journalist Sean Plunket of New Zealand’s Magic Talk (http://bit.ly/2SSWHyb), who interviewed the writer/spokesperson for the Auckland Peace Action group, Iris Krzyzosiak . I think it is rather charitable to describe the results as distinctly unhelpful for the Peace Action group. 

In this video compilation, I read part of the original press release, then present Sean’s interview with Ms. Kryzosiak, so you can make up your own minds about the opinions of her group, and follow that with an extended interview, with an audience Q and A that I conducted with Sean a day later.

Hope to see you in New Zealand: See www.jordanbpeterson.com for tickets remaining in the New Zealand venues: Wellington and Auckland, as well as Australia, later: Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.

We discussed our long term friendship, beginning when I taught Gregg at Harvard, the strange relationship between his books and my rules, Gregg's commercial/action fiction and its purpose, and the role of responsibility, meaning and adventure.

Leaders: Myth & Reality: General Stanley McChrystal,2019-02-04T19:54:16Z,PT1H15M54S,234111,6976,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"I had the opportunity to speak recently with General Stanley McChrystal, retired four-star general, former Commander of the International Security Assistance Force and Commander, US Forces, Afghanistan. Since 2010, he has taught courses in international relations at Yale University as a Senior Fellow of the University's Jackson Institute for Global Affairs. 

General McChrystal is also the the bestselling author of Leaders: Myth and Reality, described by the publisher as follows: “Leadership is not what you think it is… and it never was. Find out why in our new book Leaders: Myth and Reality which explains why leaders are important, but rarely for the reasons we think. Leaders, the follow up to New York Times bestseller Team of Teams and Wall Street Journal bestseller One Mission, profiles 13 historical leaders and reveals essential lessons on leading today.”

Wikipedia has the following biographical note, of some interest: “McChrystal was reportedly known for saying what other military leaders were thinking but were afraid to say; this was one of the reasons cited for his appointment to lead all forces in Afghanistan, and also the reason he was later relieved of that command.” 

General McChrystal is also spearheading programs designed to integrated disaffected young people into responsible citizenship, including the ServiceYear Alliance (https://about.serviceyear.org/), described in the following terms:

“Service years are available in a variety of focus areas, including: education, environment, disaster relief, nonprofit capacity, and many more. You can find opportunities across the country on the ServiceYear.org — our online platform that makes it easy for young people to search for the perfect opportunity. Whether you’re in high school or college, or looking to find your path — a service year gives you the chance to develop leadership and professional skills, make an impact on the lives of others, and become the active citizens and leaders our nation needs.”

Perhaps this is what you’re looking for—or something you would consider supporting as a voting and communicating citizen. 

It was a pleasure speaking with General McChrystal.

Interview with the grievance studies hoaxers,2019-01-11T11:40:08Z,PT1H18M15S,618496,22767,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"In the second week of January (2019) I spoke with Dr. Peter Boghossian, Dr. James Lindsay, and Helen Pluckrose, authors of the infamous “Grievance studies” hoax papers. We discussed their motivations and the consequences of their actions. 

Portland State University is currently taking disciplinary actions against Dr. Boghossian, having found him guilty of academic misconduct for failing to have PSU’s Institutional Review Board approve his ""studies"" before they were conducted (!) 

Draw your own conclusions...

"Responsibility, conscience and meaning",2019-01-07T16:47:06Z,PT1H38M2S,285289,6647,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Every time I talk publicly about the relationship between responsibility and meaning, the audience falls silent...

Timon Dias, editor of Geenstijl, the largest Dutch weblog, interviewed me, for the second time, on January 6th (we had spoken a year before: https://bit.ly/2Ay0k2i). 

This interview covered: 

1. a review of my lecture tour and other activities last year;
2. the political-correctness-inspired attempt to replace the narrative of individual identity with that of the collective;
3. The archetypal structure of the movie ""Gladiator"";
4. The role of the artist as mediator between the dream world and consciousness;
5. The idea of individuation (a concept of Carl Jung).

Goodbye to Patreon,2019-01-01T15:59:21Z,PT31M,521563,26188,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"In this video, Dave Rubin and I focus on four issues:

(1) our departure from Patreon (as of Jan 15, 2019);
(2) plans to create an alternative creator-funding platform, with multiple payment options, and with protection for free speech foremost and center as a guiding principle;
(3) the exceptional danger posed by the increasing willingness of payment processors such as MasterCard, Visa and PayPal to monitor, judge and regulate the spending habits of their customers;
(4) the pressure being applied to such companies by organizations designed precisely for that purpose (such as “Change the Terms (https://www.changetheterms.org/), aimed at the elimination of what they regard as “hate speech” online and everywhere else).

"Take Aim, Even Badly",2018-12-21T20:24:42Z,PT6M56S,457181,17143,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"A brief video on the utility of taking aim--even badly. At least it's a start. Most of the positive emotion that will characterize your life (at least of the sustaining kind) will be a consequence of watching yourself move successfully toward a valued goal. That means that there is little chance of meaningfully happiness and fulfillment in the absence of well-defined and high-order goals.

So make some :)

Dr. Jordan B Peterson on Femsplainers,2018-12-21T18:32:23Z,PT1H30M10S,4352204,91429,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"On December 13, 2018, I was a guest on Femsplainers with Christina Hoff Sommers and Danielle Crittenden. We discussed, among other topics, the secrets of a long marriage, the problems with dating apps, how to handle a belligerent toddler, and the motivation of my radical feminist critics. 

Femsplainers (http://femsplainers.com/) is “the gossipy, smart, witty conversation you’d have if all of your girlfriends (and some of your guy friends too!) were experts on the hot topics of the moment. High spirited and high minded, we don’t argue or whine but seek to get to the heart of the matter, over cocktails (or wine).” We taped in front of a live audience at AEI, the American Enterprise Institute (http://www.aei.org/

Ms. Hoff Sommers is the author of Who Stole Feminism? (https://amzn.to/2GJnkR4) and The War Against Boys (https://amzn.to/2SeuYo5) (a NY Times Notable Book of the Year) as well as Freedom Feminism (https://amzn.to/2Sfrd1B) , One Nation Under Therapy (https://amzn.to/2rNABOe) (with Dr. S. Satel), and The Science on Women in Science (https://amzn.to/2RaZyS1). She is resident scholar at AEI, studying the politics of gender and feminism, as well as free expression, due process, and the preservation of liberty in the academy. She has written for The Journal of Philosophy, The New England Journal of Medicine, The Wall Street Journal, The NY Times, The Washington Post, The New Republic, Slate, The Daily Beast, and The Atlantic, and is host of the popular video blog, The Factual Feminist. 

Ms. Crittenden is the author of What Our Mothers Didn’t Tell Us (https://amzn.to/2BBtzAC), a novel, AmandaBright@Home (https://amzn.to/2Lwr33c) (the first modern work of fiction serialized in the Wall Street Journal) and a cookbook, From a Polish Country House Kitchen (https://amzn.to/2Ra1H0n)(with Pulitzer-prize winner Anne Applebaum). She is a contributing editor to the Huffington Post, and has published in the Wall Street Journal, the NY Times, the Washington Post, and the Daily Telegraph. A former columnist for the New York Post, Ms. Crittendon has appeared on NBC’s Today show as well as CSPAN, MSNBC, PBS, CNN, and NPR.

How to make the world better. Really. With Dr. Bjørn Lomborg.,2018-12-07T23:47:17Z,PT1H27M19S,306694,11163,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"On December 7, 2018, I spoke with Dr. Bjorn Lomborg, author and President of Copenhagen Consensus Center, a singularly innovative and influential US-based think tank. Dr. Lomborg and his team have done the hard conceptual and empirical work necessary to turn good intentions for global improvement into implementable and economically efficient strategies. That's really saying something.
 
They have, among other things, analyzed the UN Millenial goals (169 of them, which is far too many), prioritizing and rank-ordering them in terms of practical implementability and costs and benefits. Those who claim to truly care about the world's dispossessed could do far worse than to study Dr. Lomborg's work.

The Democrats: Apology and Promise,2018-11-07T18:54:54Z,PT4M19S,455410,13025,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"This is the ad i wished I had heard the Democrats deliver.

We are the Democrats. Since 1828, our great party has played a major role in participating in the political process that has produced what is arguably the greatest republic the world has ever seen. We've produced generation after generation of leaders whom, despite their faults, have helped establish and maintain a country that has served in the main as a beacon of light and hope to the desperate masses of the world, yearning in those immemorial words to breathe free.

Over those nearly two hundred years, we have all worked together, despite our differences, to produce a society where desperate want is a rarity, where hard working men and women can produce a better future for themselves and their children, and where the arbitrary disadvantages that have in the past held so many of us back and deprived others of our genuine talents have in good faith been continually reduced and minimized.

Nothing is perfect, and neither is our country, but we have built, together, a stable, secure, exciting dynamic community,  and can all, in consequence, look forward to an even better tomorrow.

But we, as Democrats, have faltered in our duty in recent years. We have allowed the discourse within our ranks to become increasingly dominated by a tiny, well organized and disruptive minority, who have insisted ever more stridently that our culture is a tyrannical, destructive  patriarchy, and that we are not sovereign, responsible individual citizens, capable of negotiating a shared and prosperous peace, but oppressive or oppressed minority group members, defined above all by our sex, race, ethnicity and sexual preference. 

We failed, as well, to oppose the the profoundly anti-American claim that free speech is merely the means by which the powerful protect their interests, and we abandoned our invaluable commitment to and contract with the American working class, who toiled mightily and often under conditions of extreme deprivation to perform the backbreaking labor so necessary to the creation of our stellar country.

In doing so, we betrayed and insulted our primary constituency, and we squandered the opportunity to elect the first woman to the position of the Presidency of the USA. Then, instead of taking responsibility for our well-deserved failure and loss, we insisted upon vilifying those who defeated us appropriately and honestly in the honorable democratic process.

We're sorry. 

We promise to return to the priorities that made our party great. We promise to build and the vital infrastructure whose construction employs our trades people and whose use is available to all. We promise to insist that our schools and those who conduct the research upon which their methods are founded abandon their divisive ideology and teach our children the knowledge and skills necessary to make them respectable, mature, productive reliable citizens. We promise, and have already taken productive steps, to reduce the inevitable corruption that tends to take hold of even the greatest and most alert of states.

We're the Democrats. We did not uphold our responsibility to the American people, and we're justly and properly sorry for that. We promise to clean our house. We promise to draw divisions between the key and time honored principles that unite us all and the divisive identity politics that is threatening to reduce us to an ignoble, squabbling and dangerously polarized tribalism. 

We’re the Democrats. We hope you'll forgive us, and we promise by the sacred social compact defined by our unalienable individual rights to act responsibly and carefully and do better, together.

Long may our great country prosper.

--------------------------------------------

You may wonder why a Canadian might involve himself in such an endeavor. It's partly because everything that happens in the USA happens to us, too -- later. So some moderation of the political polarization currently afflicting the west everywhere -- beginning, perhaps, in the USA, would be good for everyone.

Foreword to The Gulag Archipelago: 50th Anniversary,2018-11-01T00:14:11Z,PT47M31S,349172,13217,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"I had the great privilege of writing the foreword to the 50th anniversary version of the abridged version of one of the most important books of the 20th century, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's The Gulag Archipelago, a devastating account of the absolute horror wreaked upon the people of the Soviet Empire by the acolytes of the doctrine of Karl Marx. I read the foreword here, in its entirety, and encourage everyone to purchase and study the book. It changed the world. 

The 50th anniversary version of The Gulag Archipelago is available at Amazon UK at https://amzn.to/2CQ8O6O or at multiple booksellers on the dedicated Penguin Random House page at 
 https://bit.ly/2Q2CUrb

NOTE: The North American license is held by Harper Collins, and the book is not available in its 50th anniversary form except from the sellers above.

Lewis Howes (www.lewishowes.com) interviewed me in July 2018. He put up the discussion in two parts (Part 1: https://bit.ly/2BNk0SN; Part 2: https://bit.ly/2yI0QbW). People seem pleased with the discussion. I talked to Lewis and we decided that reposting it here might bring it to the attention of more people. The episodes here have been combined into one post.

Built not Bought: Comments on New Democrat Messaging,2018-09-26T01:36:20Z,PT18M16S,309146,12312,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"In this video, I'm analyzing a political ad/short, Built not Bought, recently released by Future Majority, a PAC associated with the Democrats, a group hoping to bring some sense back into the US political scene. 

The filmmakers, Future Majority, have this to say about their organization and the film:

""After the election in 2016, we created a political organization to work on the important issue of expanding the reach of Democrats and focusing on shared core values. Future Majority, under the leadership of Mark Riddle, continues to work on a vast scale to re-brand and define the party, particularly in red and purple states and districts, in an effort to shore up our base, speak to swing voters, and turn out those voters who we lost in the last election. 

""Built Not Bought,"" created by Marshall Herskovitz, Gregg Hurwitz, and Callie Khouri, is the cornerstone of a new initiative that answers the question: What do Democrats Stand For? 

The four-minute film celebrates the singular importance of working people in the creation of modern America, while calling out the big-donor influences that have eroded our democratic institutions over the past few decades. It is a patriotic, optimistic, solutions-oriented affirmation of core American values -- decency, fair-play, the belief in a boundless future -- that seem too often forgotten in our partisan era. It is a call to action, to build a future that is just and free, full of hope and opportunity.""

See https://www.futuremajority.org/

Five weeks prior to the release of Built not Bought I posted this YouTube discussion with Gregg Hurwitz (August 8, 2018):

The Coddling of the American Mind: Haidt/Lukianoff,2018-09-19T14:13:53Z,PT1H41M55S,447962,11033,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"The Coddling of the American Mind on Amazon: https://amzn.to/2QJ20MQ

Consider this book as a gift for your local school board member, teacher or principal. The more educational professionals become aware of the issues it presents, and the dangers of our current hyper-protective preoccupations, the better the chances we'll change course. 

I spoke with Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt September 18, 2018 about their new book, The Coddling of the American Mind -- a treatise on the counterproductive but increasingly predominant ""safety culture"" of trigger warnings, safe spaces and microaggression sensitivity. 

We discussed the psychological and sociological factors that underlie this philosophy of fragility, over-protection and offense, considering the contribution of older parents, fewer siblings, the strange interaction of postmodern philosophy and Marxism on campuses, and the widespread use of social media by young people.

We focused on the increasing proclivity of those teaching in the social sciences and humanities to characterize Western culture as patriarchal and oppressive; producing, as a secondary consequence, a pervasive and all-encompassing victim/victimizer narrative (and producing that partly for the purposes of justifying that characterization). 

We considered what steps might be taken, personally and socially, to produce an alternate culture of resilience, responsibility, strength and courage.

AD Harris/Murray/Peterson Discussion: London,2018-09-14T14:35:22Z,PT1H56M15S,1833945,31952,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"This is the fourth video of the four-part debate that Sam Harris and I undertook in June 2018. 

Sam and I met twice in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, with Bret Weinstein moderating, for a third time in Dublin, Ireland, and for a fourth and final time in London, England. Douglas Murray joined the debate with us for the latter two occasions.

Video 1: Vancouver: https://bit.ly/2OlRZUa
Video 2: Vancouver: https://bit.ly/2CUQT0g
Video 3: https://bit.ly/2CUa0HG
Video 4: https://bit.ly/2On6Y0a

Sam is a well-known Enlightenment rationalist, and a prominent atheist – one of the “four horsemen,” along with Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens (now unfortunately deceased) and Daniel Dennett. He believes (1) that our ethical systems should or even must be grounded in something other than arbitrary revelation or opinion; (2) that the world of facts can and should provide that grounding; and (3) that the grounding of values in fact can occur in the absence of much perceptual or cognitive intermediation. 
I agree with him with regard to point (1) but not point (2) and (3). I won’t present any of my argument here, however, because Sam isn’t here to respond, as he is in the videos. 

I have also written three blog posts on the Harris/Peterson discussions, here:

1. https://jordanbpeterson.com/philosophy/facts-and-values-science-and-religion-notes-on-the-sam-harris-discussions-part-i/

2. https://jordanbpeterson.com/philosophy/facts-from-values-not-without-an-intermediary-notes-on-the-sam-harris-discussions-part-ii/

3. TBA

A note on the release of the videos, and their delay: Any event of this scale occurs because of the collaboration of many people, including, in this case. Travis Pangburn and his staff at Pangburn Philosophy, who organized and promoted the four-part debate series, and who incurred substantial financial and reputational risk in doing so (as nothing like this has been attempted before at this scale). None of us were sure at the outset whether Sam and I would manage a useful discussion, let alone four of them, or whether there would be a positive public response. In consequence, we didn’t spend much time before the debate series thinking about release (or formatting/editing) of video or audio recording. Since the events went well, however – appearing both productive and well-received publicly – we decided to move ahead with the production and release of the recordings. The team at Pangburn Philosophy completed the editing, in consequence. Sam and I agreed to allow the initial release behind Travis’s Patreon paywall, for a two-week period, after which we would post the videos for full public access on our respective video platforms, and release the audio in podcast form. The team at Pangburn Philosophy plans to use some substantial portion of what was raised through Patreon subscription for multi-language translation of their previously produced and future content (including these four debates).

Iceland: 12 Rules for Life Tour: Lecture 2,2018-09-10T13:46:14Z,PT2H2M4S,294122,6200,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"There are two videos from Iceland, covering different material. This is the second. The first is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM_QPCxCkws

I have been touring since January, discussing my books, 12 Rules for Life and, to a lesser extent, Maps of Meaning (see www.jordanbpeterson.com/events for details, including upcoming tour dates and cities.  

I was in Iceland in June and gave two lectures (June 04, Lecture 1; June 05, Lecture 2), followed by a Q and A. I was hosted by Gunnlaugur Jonsson, who also introduced both talks.

I've been using the lectures as an opportunity to extend, develop and publicly test the ideas I presented in 12 Rules and Maps of Meaning.

My wife Tammy and I had a remarkable and memorable trip to Iceland. My mother and aunt also came for the adventure, and were treated with exceptional care by Gunnlaugur and his crew. We are looking forward to returning to Iceland in 2019,

Thank you very much to Halldór Fannar Kristjánsson (Sigurgeirsson) for the video recording and editing.

AB Harris/Weinstein/Peterson Discussion: Vancouver,2018-08-31T15:54:46Z,PT2H16M23S,522314,10589,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Harris/Weinstein/Peterson: Discussion 02: Vancouver

This is the second video of the four-part debate that Sam Harris and I undertook in June 2018. 

Sam and I met twice in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, with Bret Weinstein moderating, for a third time in Dublin, Ireland, and for a fourth and final time in London, England. Douglas Murray joined the debate with us for the latter two occasions. 

Video 1: Vancouver: https://bit.ly/2OlRZUa
Video 2: Vancouver: https://bit.ly/2CUQT0g
Video 3: https://bit.ly/2CUa0HG
Video 4: https://bit.ly/2On6Y0a

Sam is a well-known Enlightenment rationalist, and a prominent atheist – one of the “four horsemen,” along with Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens (now unfortunately deceased) and Daniel Dennett. He believes (1) that our ethical systems should or even must be grounded in something other than arbitrary revelation or opinion; (2) that the world of facts can and should provide that grounding; and (3) that the grounding of values in fact can occur in the absence of much perceptual or cognitive intermediation. 
I agree with him with regard to point (1) but not point (2) and (3). I won’t present any of my argument here, however, because Sam isn’t here to respond, as he is in the videos. 

I have also written three blog posts on the Harris/Peterson discussions, here:

1. https://jordanbpeterson.com/philosophy/facts-and-values-science-and-religion-notes-on-the-sam-harris-discussions-part-i/

2. https://jordanbpeterson.com/philosophy/facts-from-values-not-without-an-intermediary-notes-on-the-sam-harris-discussions-part-ii/

3. TBA

A note on the release of the videos, and their delay: Any event of this scale occurs because of the collaboration of many people, including, in this case. Travis Pangburn and his staff at Pangburn Philosophy, who organized and promoted the four-part debate series, and who incurred substantial financial and reputational risk in doing so (as nothing like this has been attempted before at this scale). None of us were sure at the outset whether Sam and I would manage a useful discussion, let alone four of them, or whether there would be a positive public response. In consequence, we didn’t spend much time before the debate series thinking about release (or formatting/editing) of video or audio recording. Since the events went well, however – appearing both productive and well-received publicly – we decided to move ahead with the production and release of the recordings. The team at Pangburn Philosophy completed the editing, in consequence. Sam and I agreed to allow the initial release behind Travis’s Patreon paywall, for a two-week period, after which we would post the videos for full public access on our respective video platforms, and release the audio in podcast form. The team at Pangburn Philosophy plans to use some substantial portion of what was raised through Patreon subscription for multi-language translation of their previously produced and future content (including these four debates).

"On the Vital Necessity of Free Speech (are you listening, Saudis)?",2018-08-21T02:43:18Z,PT30M52S,359921,16834,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"The Montreal Press Club marked the occasion of its 70th anniversary in 2018 by initiating a “Freedom Award” to mark the accomplishments of a single exceptionally courageous individual in the world of journalism. They chose as their first recipient Saudi blogger Raif Badawi (https://www.raifbadawi.org/), who has been tortured and imprisoned for his views by the oh-so-enlightened rulers of that state. I delivered this lecture on free speech on the occasion of the acceptance of the Press Club award by Raif Badawi's wife, Ensaf Haidar, April 26/2018 (video uploaded August 20). 

It is an interesting sidenote that the Blue Metropolis Literary Festival, which held the event in collaboration with the Press Club, disavowed their support (https://twitter.com/metropolisbleu/status/976201304648355840?lang=en) because of the complaints of one Sean Michaels, as I Tweeted here (https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson/status/984217716344094720?lang=en). Journalist Barbara Kay expressed her opinion about all of that here: https://nationalpost.com/opinion/barbara-kay-another-cultural-institution-succumbs-to-jordan-peterson-hysteria

Nectarine News (https://thenectarine.ca/) recorded this talk and 
provided permission for me to repost it. The original can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Sz2-6RNkjY

It's very unlikely that the Saudis are listening. Tyrants don't listen.

Gregg Hurwitz – An Invitation to the Intellectual Dark Web,2018-08-08T20:12:04Z,PT1H25M16S,255378,6366,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"I spoke today with author Gregg Hurwitz (more information about him below). Hurwitz is currently working to rebrand the Democratic party, working to produce an issues-oriented, anti-corruption, practical mainstream narrative and to identify promising Democratic candidates who can hold their own in long form political discussions.

This is all in an attempt to end the dangerous polarization and concentration on ever more extreme ideology that seems to be destabilizing political discussion.

The video is in large part an invitation to the long-form discussion providers of the so-called Intellectual Dark Web to engage with such candidates, so that the public can see beyond the sound bites and spin and impression management and message crafting that has become an integral but pathological part of our traditional low-bandwidth media communication technology.

Let's see if we can find political candidates who can shine in a three hour discussion. We're done with the oversimplifications of the traditional media forms. 


Background: Gregg Hurwitz is the New York Times, #1 internationally bestselling author of 20 thrillers, including OUT OF THE DARK (2019), and two award-winning thriller novels for teens. His novels have won numerous literary awards, graced top ten lists, and have been published in 30 languages. Gregg has written screenplays for or sold spec scripts to many of the major studios (including THE BOOK OF HENRY), and written, developed, and produced television  for various networks. He is also a New York Times Bestselling comic book writer, having penned stories for Marvel (Wolverine, Punisher) and DC (Batman, Penguin). He has published numerous academic articles on Shakespeare, taught fiction writing in the USC English Department, and guest lectured for UCLA, and for Harvard in the United States and internationally. In the course of researching his thrillers, he has sneaked onto demolition ranges with Navy SEALs, swum with sharks in the Galápagos, and gone undercover into mind-control cults. Hurwitz grew up in the Bay Area. While completing a BA from Harvard and a master’s from Trinity College, Oxford in Shakespearean tragedy, he wrote his first novel. He was the undergraduate scholar-athlete of the year at Harvard for his pole-vaulting exploits, and played college soccer in England, where he was a Knox fellow. 

He has increasingly turned his attention to the political sphere, in an effort to end polarizing discourse:

·      Rebranding the entire Democratic party

·      Working with a number of candidates and entities, from senators to the DNC/DCCC/DLCC

·      Effort to get away from gridlock and into solutions

I have been touring since January, discussing my books, 12 Rules for Life and, to a lesser extent, Maps of Meaning (see www.jordanbpeterson.com/events for details, including upcoming tour dates and cities.  

I was in Iceland in June and gave two lectures (June 04, Lecture 1; June 05, Lecture 2), followed by a Q and A. I was hosted by Gunnlaugur Jonsson, who also introduced both talks.

I've been using the lectures as an opportunity to extend, develop and publicly test the ideas I presented in 12 Rules and Maps of Meaning.

My wife Tammy and I had a remarkable and memorable trip to Iceland. My mother and aunt also came for the adventure, and were treated with exceptional care by Gunnlaugur and his crew. We are looking forward to returning to Iceland in 2019,

Thank you very much to Halldór Fannar Kristjánsson (Sigurgeirsson) for the video recording and editing.

Former Australian Deputy PM John Anderson and I speak again,2018-07-26T12:15:22Z,PT53M34S,161431,5648,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"The Right Honorable John Anderson and I had the opportunity to speak once again, continuing to develop the themes we outlined in our original discussion (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4NijLf3M-A&t=169s). 

Mr. Anderson was was Deputy PM of Australia and leader of the National Party from 1999 to 2005. He was a member of the House of Representatives from 1989 to 2007, and served as Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (1996–1998) and for Transport and Regional Development (1998–2005) in the Howard Government. Ten of the twelve budgets he helped mastermind produced a surplus -- a record unmatched by any other Western governments.

I will be traveling to Australia and New Zealand in February, and plan to meet with Mr. Anderson again then, as well. 

We spoke about responsibility, the meaning of life, the growing public interest in philosophical discussion (driven in part by technologies such as online video), political polarization and classical liberal values, among other topics.

The Lindsay Shepherd Affair: Update,2018-06-20T23:05:26Z,PT36M37S,2718738,62344,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"I'm sure many of you remember Lindsay Shepherd, the teaching assistant at Wilfred Laurier University who was subjected to an unwarranted inquisition after showing a video of me debating Nicholas Matte about Bill C16. 

In her statement of claim (which I read in its totality in this video), Shepherd notes that her mistreatment continued unabated at Wilfred Laurier, despite the university's hypothetical apology and offer to mend its ways. She also claimed that she has been rendered unemployable as an academic (a claim I believe, having served on many university search committees, and knowing full well that any whiff of scandal is enough to disquality a candidate entirely). 

I talked to her lawyer after reading her claim, and decided that I would also pursue Wilfred Laurier and the professors and administrators directly responsible for this debacle.

I am not convinced that Wilfred Laurier learned what needed to be learned even after being dragged through the national and international press, in what was the biggest scandal that ever hit a Canadian university. 

Maybe two lawsuits will help rectify that. We'll see. 

NOTE: The allegations in these statements of claim are simply that, at this stage. They have not been tested in a court of law, and cannot therefore be considered proved.

23 Minutes from Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief,2018-06-16T15:17:04Z,PT23M23S,257062,6662,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Just released: Audiobook of Maps of Meaning: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/  

I did the reading. 

Maps of Meaning, my first book, delves much deeper into the ideas  in my YouTube videos, podcasts and 12 Rules. It's a difficult book. Writing it took me to the edge of my intellectual ability. However, I 
I believe that the audio book version is much more accessible,  because of the opportunity for dramatization afforded by a recording. 

I will be posting a series of 30 minute excerpts over the next few weeks.

""An interview with Canadian clinical psychologist Jordan Peterson, author of the bestselling book 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos. Peterson discusses child upbringing, the so-called oppression of the patriarchy and feminism, truthfulness and “life-lies” and why it is bad to avoid conflict in relationships and in the workplace. Peterson also answers recent criticism from Bernard Schiff, his friend and former colleague at the University of Toronto.""

I missed mentioning Winnipeg, but it's definitely on the tour. Apologies to the denizens of Manitoba. Nothing personal. 

https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcasts/podcast-episode/48-ben-shapiro/ for podcast version

Shapiro discussion starts at 4:10 if you want to skip the tour information. 

This is an alternate posting of Ben Shapiro's May 6 premiere Sunday Special discussion with me (https://bit.ly/2I4czoU). 

Ben and I had a very intense discussion about the nesting of human perception and cognition in the mythic world - a better discussion, I think, than I've had with anyone.

I've added to the beginning of our discussion an update on available tickets for my US 12 Rules for Life tour, and an announcement of 10 additional Canadian dates (see www.jordanbpeterson.com/events). 

I hope you find the discussion useful.

College Conservatism 2018: Charlie Kirk & Turning Point USA,2018-05-13T09:26:16Z,PT1H22M22S,271718,9516,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"A number of people in recent months suggested that I speak with Charlie Kirk, a young man who heads Turning Point USA (https://www.tpusa.com/), an organization whose mission is, in its own words, to "" educate students about the importance of fiscal responsibility, free markets, and limited government."" Turning Point has a presence on more than 1000 campus, and appears to be growing quickly. It seems to me to be a reaction to the overwhelming dominance of radical left ideology in such arenas. We discussed his views, recent activity, and future plans.

The absolute necessity of fathers: Warren Farrell/JB Peterson,2018-05-06T15:49:58Z,PT1H34M50S,314033,11544,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"I came across Dr. Warren Farrell's work a few years ago, when I read Why Men Earn More (https://amzn.to/2HX3Epj), a careful study of the many reasons for the existence of the ""gender pay gap,"" attributed by ideologues of the identity-politics persuasion to systemic patriarchal prejudice and oppression. Farrell has recently published another book, The Boy Crisis (https://amzn.to/2wnApuy) with Dr. John Gray. We spent an intense 90 minutes discussing the crucial role played by fathers in child development, paying particular attention to play and delay of gratification.

Dr. Farrell has been a target of radical left activists, who object to the conflict between his careful analysis and their unidimensional ideology. You can see an example of this here, at the University of Toronto: https://bit.ly/1eS5yHe

When people say ""what do you want to be when you grow up?"" in our society they usually mean ""what career are you going to pick?"" It's really not the way the question should be conceptualized. You should really think about what sort of character you want to have. You want to grow up and be a responsible, forthright and honest person. It's the best way through life.

Parents need to be courageous because they have to let their children go and make mistakes. You have to let your children fall when they're learning to walk. There's a certain amount of detached harshness that has to go along with your love and compassion. You have to stand back and let your child stumble forward to mastery.

Compilation: The Death and Resurrection of Christ: A Commentary in Five Parts,2018-04-05T21:00:22Z,PT1H3M46S,709523,16641,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"This video is derived from five sources:

Part 1: The Nature of Experience (from my first book Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/)

Part 2: Some Axioms of the Christian Revolutionary Story (created for this video)

Part 3: Narratives and Sacrifice (taken from Rule 7: Pursue what is meaningful, not what is expedient, in my new book, 12 Rules for Life (https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/)

Part 4: On the Ark of the Covenant, the Cathedral and the Cross: Easter Message I (from my blog at https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/) 

Part 5: The Psychological Meaning of the Death and Resurrection of Christ: Easter Message II (an extended version of an Easter article I wrote for the London Sunday Times (https://bit.ly/2GEnC7B)

The idea of the death and resurrection has a psychological meaning, in addition to its metaphysical and religious significance. It can be thought of as part of the structure of narrative that sits at the basis of our culture. It includes elements of sacrifice (associated with delay of gratification and the discovery of the future) and psychological transformation (as movement forward in life often requires the death of something old and the birth of something new). 

This five-part commentary is an attempt to explain such ideas in detail so that they can be understood, as well as “believed.”

Australia's John Anderson & Dr. Jordan B Peterson: In Conversation,2018-04-03T16:34:37Z,PT1H23M58S,1189004,33212,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"I was in Australia in mid-March of 2018, speaking in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne. While I was there, I had the privilege of speaking to former Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson (Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/johnandersonao/), who is described accurately on Wikipedia as ""handsome, well-educated and well-spoken."" 

Mr. Anderson introduced one of my Australian lectures. We also had the opportunity to talk together for a few hours, and to complete this interview. We discussed many things -- responsibility, freedom, meaning in life, the polarization of viewpoints in the West, the ideological use of language and identity politics. 

It seems to me that the sensible fiscal policies Mr. Anderson pursued during his governmental tenure in Australia constitute a model for good governance in the West. 

Mr. Anderson has started a conversation series, where he discusses important philosophical, political and cultural issues. It can be found at https://johnanderson.net.au/media/ and on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtnYSEGViOnb7k8ezUaWUww

He can be followed on Twitter @JohnAndersonAO

The Queen's University Talk: The  Rising Tide of Compelled Speech,2018-03-12T04:36:27Z,PT1H46M21S,1337535,39424,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"I was invited to Queen's University March 5 to give the inaugural lecture/discussion of the Liberty Lecture series, funded by Faculty of Law alumnus, Gregory Piasetzki (LLB 1980). 

Dr. Bruce Pardy (https://law.queensu.ca/faculty-research/faculty-directory/pardy) and I discussed the increasingly frequent requirements for compelled speech that characterize the Canadian sociopolitical landscape. 

The entire event was, in a word, surreal. Initial controversy over its acceptability rose to the point where the Dean of the Law School William Flanagan and Principal of Queen’s Daniel Woolf wrote missives in defence of free speech (the former: http://bit.ly/2EQJDm3; the latter: http://bit.ly/2tJB8VB). The Queen's University ""Human Rights Office"" posted a link to the Levana Gender Advocacy Centre and Education on Queer Issues Project ""active support"" efforts during this event at their “Trans-Positive and People of Colour Positive Chill-In” in Dunning Hall, room 11, where there was coloring pages, music, food, and discussion. 

The 900 or so people who attended (who comported themselves admirably and thoughtfully throughout) were subject to a continual 90-minute barrage of noise generated by the protestors, who leaped up on the stained glass windows lining the hall and banged continually on them, breaking one. Inside, we could see shadowy figures dimly outlined through the colored glass. The outside doors were barricaded. One protestor was caught on film saying ""Lock them in and burn it down."" The din was substantial and ominous, although it is much attenuated in this video, due to the nature of the microphones used, which were designed to pick up speech close at hand. 

The protestor who broke the window was arrested, but not before she bit a policeman, attempted to kick the back window out of a police cruiser, and was found to be in possession of a garrotte, a particularly brutal weapon with no defensive utility whatsoever (http://bit.ly/2HoTDAu). The man who cursed so profoundly and eloquently near the beginning of the lecture accosted me and my crew after the talk, and yelled and cursed and threatened at close quarters during our 200-yard walk from the venue to the parkade.

No one who was at this event will forget it. 

Not good. Not good at all.

Quillette: Discussion with Founder/Editor Claire Lehmann,2018-03-10T22:17:13Z,PT1H8M20S,182343,5436,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Please consider supporting Quillette’s fine work through Patreon at https://www.patreon.com/Quillette/overview

I sat down recently with Claire Lehmann, founder and editor of Quillette, an online magazine that publishes essays on a range of topics related to politics, social life, science, and academia. The magazine has quickly become a highly respected outlet for open discussion of topics in psychology and the social and behavioral sciences. 

Claire was studying forensic psychology at the graduate level but decided that she could contribute more to the general scientific discussion as a journalist. Hence her decision to found Quillette. In this discussion, she describes the founding, development and monetization strategy underpinning her journalistic work. From Wikipedia: “The website drew significant public attention on August 7, 2017 after publishing the responses of four scientists (Lee Jussim, David P. Schmitt, Geoffrey Miller, and Debra W. Soh) to James Damore's controversial memo ""Google's Ideological Echo Chamber"". The website was temporarily shut down by a DDoS attack following publication of the piece.”

Claire stated, during our discussion: “I didn’t think that any standard journalistic outlet would publish the material, scientific or otherwise, that I considered valuable and appropriate. The best places for scientific journalism won’t go near anything that contradicts very strong left-wing narratives such as the reality of stereotype threat (a literature severely criticized in http://bit.ly/2oVINv6), the validity of intelligence research, or the existence of sex differences in personality and interest.” I provided an extensive reference list with regard to the latter in the description for my video commentary on the James Damore/Google affair: http://bit.ly/2HmfIQ6). David Schmitt’s work (summarized here: https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/201711/the-truth-about-sex-differences) is also relevant in this regard.  
We discussed the failure of psychologists to admit to, let alone identify, authoritarian tendencies on the left since the end of World War II, although there has been no shortage of work detailing those tendencies on the right. In my lab, we recently tried to rectify this with some recent as-of-yet unpublished studies making up the Master’s thesis work of my student Christine Brophy (see http://bit.ly/2eXN3m2). 

Claire and I also discussed the danger to women (particularly mothers) as a consequence of the social-constructionist denial of the biological differences between the sexes and the practical necessity of distinguishing between “women” and “mothers” in the economic discussion, the over-emphasis on career compared to family that is characteristic of modern life, the impossibility of a high-achieving career, in general (to say nothing of managing that with the demands of motherhood), and the failure of feminism to address that impossibility in a realistic and measured manner.
We close with a discussion of the fraudulent and politically-motivated misuse of the concept of implicit bias and the lack of evidence for success for anti-unconscious bias retraining programs, and consideration of the differences in competition strategies between males and females in the workplace and more broadly. 

One of Quillette’s early successes, by criminologists Brian Boutwell: http://quillette.com/2015/11/13/criminologists-who-study-bio-shunned-by-field/

On the false dichotomy between sex and gender: http://quillette.com/2018/02/07/real-gender-trouble/
And, in closing, on female preference for male bosses: https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/549818/women-prefer-male-bosses/

"Message to the school shooters: past, present and future",2018-03-03T23:53:19Z,PT36M40S,951348,36338,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"I wrote in some detail and with some depth about motivation for the mass slaughter of innocents in my new book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos. Because of what happened all-too-recently and brutally in Parkland -- because of what keeps happening -- I thought I would read the relevant chapter (Rule 6: Put your house in perfect order before you criticize the world) and release it on YouTube. I regard the mass shootings as symptomatic of the nihilism and psychological confusion that so deeply characterizes our society at the current time. 

This reading will also be put up as a podcast sometime in the next week at http://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/

Our conversation was taped by Perspectiva (http://bit.ly/2EOCiU0), who described it as follows: ""An extraordinary half-hour conversation about the brain, chaos, order, freedom, evil, mythology, being, and becoming between two of the leading thinkers of our time.""

Dr. McGilchrist's book (Amazon description: a fascinating exploration of the differences between the brain’s left and right hemispheres, and how those differences have affected society, history, and culture) is available here:

I was prompted to do so by Ms. Mengjie Ma, a Chinese student studying in Germany, who has worked diligently to translate and subtitle a number of my videos. I have placed links to these in the description of the video.

Mengjie has organized a number of people to work on the translations. They have a group on Weibo: http://bit.ly/2ExqaHn

Thanks, Mengjie. Much appreciated.

I would also like to announce that my new book, 12 Rules for Life, will be translated into Chinese by Beijing Cheers Books (http://bit.ly/2Gn2K49). I don’t know the publication date yet, but will let everyone know as soon as I do know. Links to the publisher are also in the description. 

I am very pleased to hear that my lectures are finding an audience in China.

Heavens on Earth with skeptical Dr. Michael Shermer,2018-01-23T02:41:00Z,PT1H13M5S,240656,6313,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Dr. Michael Shermer’s new book Heavens on Earth: 

Amazon US: http://amzn.to/2n2fu8p
Amazon Canada: http://amzn.to/2Bj9AVf

I recently sat down with Dr. Michael Shermer, editor of Skeptic Magazine, Scientific American columnist, and author of the new book Heavens on Earth. We talked about Deepak Chopra; the place of consciousness in the world; the neuroscience, evolutionary biology and metaphysics of Heaven and Hell; the pros and cons of ideas about the afterlife; the idea of “up” as the moral aim and the potential basis for that metaphor in the reality of the social hierarchy; the Kingdom of God as a psychological reality; the reality of transcendent experience; psychedelic experience; the definition of truth; Nietzsche’s critique of Christianity; trans-humanism, the singularity, life extension and the prolongation of youth; the danger of losing our humanity in technological revolution; the malleability of identity; bodily and spiritual resurrection; the nature of the persistent and transforming self; Michael’s personal transformation from areligious to evangelical to skeptic; Sam Harris; the division of the damned from the saved (or the wheat from the chaff); Ayn Rand; Jocko Willink and the utility of striving; Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn; the truth of fiction; postmodernism and interpretation; dragons, archetypes and intrinsic brain structure; Martin Gardner; responsibility; social ethics; the nature of belief; the collapse of free will into determinism as the future shades into the present; moral accountability and the law; the aim of his new book (Heavens on Earth); a meaningful life and working to make the world a better place… and that’s about that.

"To Junior High, High School Students & Their Parents",2018-01-03T04:21:16Z,PT1H12M16S,523427,22110,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"In this video, I make a radical suggestion, preceded by a careful, detailed argument that this suggestion is justified. 

In short: I think students should (with the backing of their parents, if possible) leave their junior high and high school classes if any of the following topics arise.This means that they should stand up, note their objections to the content of the class (""This sounds like indoctrination to me, rather than education, so I'm leaving""), and then walk out. Perhaps they could encourage a classmate/friend to videotape their actions, and post it on YouTube. Topics warranting such a response?

Diversity
Inclusivity
Equity

(Conveniently, these form the acronym DIE, which is exactly what the philosophy underpinning their grouping and use should be encouraged to do.)

White Privilege
Systemic Racism
Gender

I am not claiming that there is nothing to be learned about such topics, or even that they shouldn’t be discussed. What I am saying is that if they are brought up in an elementary, junior high or high school classroom the odds are very high that the “lesson” to be learned will be one driven by ideological/propagandistic concerns, rather than one aimed at the inculcation of knowledge, wisdom or skill. 

There will be mistakes made with such an approach. Some who discuss issues such as inclusivity and equity are going to be more reasonable than others, but that does not change the fact that the philosophy driving the pushing forward of such topics is essentially ideological and propagandistic. So I think such active resistance will get the point across very effectively. It is too bad that it has come to this, but it has. Think long and hard about it. My feeling is this: if effective action is not taken now to counteract the politicization of the public school curriculum, the need for such action will merely increase, and it will take much more to forestall the process later. Pick your poison.

Deconstruction: The Lindsay Shepherd Affair,2017-12-27T04:28:21Z,PT2H4M39S,1140832,31908,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"In November 2017, Wilfred Laurier University teaching assistant Lindsay Shepherd was called to a disciplinary meeting by two professors (Nathan Rambukkana and Herbert Pimlott) and one administrator (Adria Joel) to discuss her screening of a video clip from TVO's The Agenda with Steve Paikin during a class she was conducting. Shepherd taped the proceedings (http://bit.ly/2mMPvok) and released them, causing a national and international firestorm of outrage over the manner in which she was treated. 

The video clip featured me discussing the provisions of Canada's compelled speech law, Bill C16, with Professor Nicholas Matte of the Mark S Bonham Centre for Sexual Diversity Studies at the University of Toronto.

During the proceedings, Shepherd was accused of breaking the law, both federal (Bill C16) and provincial, violating Wilfred Laurier's standards of conduct, and of being actively transphobic. Rambukkana compared me directly to Hitler (and Milo Yiannopoulos, to be fair), failing to recognize that what I predicted would happen in the aftermath of Bill C16 (see http://bit.ly/2AZqj4B) was exactly what was undertaken by the tripartite disciplinary panel he headed.

Twenty of Rambukkana's colleagues signed a letter of support for his actions (http://bit.ly/2DiedjN), despite the almost universal condemnation. In addition, great efforts were made by the neo-Marxist/postmodernist/critical theory ideologues to cast Shepherd as the perpetrator, as noted in Quillette (http://bit.ly/2l3Np0h), and the Wilfred Laurier Faculty Association president wrote this missive (http://bit.ly/2C9Ulm1) decrying ""the violent speech and actions that have, unfortunately, become a daily occurrence on our campuses"" despite there being no evidence whatsoever for such violence. 

On December 18, Dr. Deborah MacLatchy, President and Vice-Chancellor of Wilfrid Laurier University, released a statement on the independent fact-finder's report on the Lindsay Shepherd affair, exonerating her completely, stating that the disciplinary meeting should have never occurred and indicating even that the claim of student complaint was essentially fabricated (although Dr. MacLatchy has released a statement of clarification about that: http://bit.ly/2C8xWWp). 

Dr. David Haskell, Associate Professor, Digital Media and Journalism / Religion and Culture and Dr. William McNally, Associate Professor of Finance at the School of Business and Economics (both of Wilfred Laurier) joined me for this discussion (December 19), where we ""deconstructed"" Dr. MacLatchy's response. They are not alone at WLU, by the way, in their opposition to the ideological zealotry that has possessed their campus, and most others. Hopefully, in 2018, more professors will come to their senses and join them. 

Why should you care? Because this is, in truth, the state of the modern university -- and what happens there will happen everywhere five years later.

This lecture closes the 2017 lecture series, and the book of Genesis. In it, I present the story of Joseph who, as the wearer of the coat of many colors, is profoundly adaptable, courageous, adaptable, merciful and just. Even in slavery -- even in prison -- he comes out triumphant, because of the strength of his character and his wisdom. Betrayed by his brothers, he acts to strengthen his family; unjustly accused by the Pharaoh's wife, he maintains his faith.

Swedes want to know....,2017-12-02T17:37:33Z,PT1H19M15S,339933,8009,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Journalist Ivar Arpi of the Swedish daily newspaper Svenska Dagbladet interviewed me last week, prior to publishing his piece today, Dec 02 2017: https://www.svd.se/jordan-b-peterson-det-finns-inget-farligare-an-en-svag-man

Ivar Axel Arpi is a works as a lead writer specializing in politics at  Svenska Dagbladet. He has previously worked as a lead writer at the Gothenburg Post, Hallandsposten and the Liberal News Agency. He has also worked as an editor at Axess magazine, and as editor of the  society magazine Neo. 

Excerpt, edited from the Google English translation of the full article: 

""In a Facebook group for Jordan B Peterson's Swedish enthusiasts I ask what he means to the team members. The answers are illustrative. 'He has given me a stronger faith and a tidy student apartment I can be proud of,' writes one. 'One great thing is that he has explained the value and importance of the Bible, which is impressive considering that I'm an atheist. Meanwhile, I have listened to Jordan B Peterson I have lost 8 kg, cleaned my home (better), handled my relationships and am more effective in my job,' wrote another. A man who watches Jordan B Peterson's videos with his equally enthusiastic wife says that doing so made them both to try to become better people... Another writes: 'In addition, he got me to talk to God again, even if it is 'just' God is in my psyche.' Peterson says, 'I give public lectures in which I talk about responsibility and truth. Afterwards, many will come up to me, mostly young men, and want to talk. They say things like ""I was a nihilist, I was desperate, I was suicidal, I was destructive and bitter, but when I heard what you had to say about the myths I took myself out of the dark hole I was in."" Person after person has been saying the same thing. And I have received thousands of such letters...' ""

Drinking from the Firehose with Howard Bloom,2017-12-01T21:52:45Z,PT1H29M1S,186498,4781,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"It’s easier in some ways to say what Howard Bloom isn’t than what he is. He’s not dull, for starters. Talking to him gave me the same sense of drinking from a fire hose that I experienced talking to Camille Paglia, who is one of the only people I have ever met who could give him a run for his money for sheer verbal fluency. He’s not someone whose existence you could believe in him if he wasn’t real, either. In fact, when I first heard about him, I thought “there’s just no way all those things can be true.”
But they are. 
His first and longest lasting love has been science. At sixteen, he worked as a research assistant studying the immune system at the Roswell Park Memorial Research Cancer Institute. While attending NYU, he edited an art magazine, to substantial critical acclaim, then an underground rock magazine (even though he knew very little, to begin with, about rock), and then head of public relations at ABC, working for Simon & Garfunkel, Michael Jackson, the Talking Heads, AC/DC, and Bob Marley (among many others). In 1985 the acts he handled grossed a third of a billion dollars. 
He’s also cofounded and chaired the Asian Space Technology Summit and serves on the board of the National Space Society.
We talked about many things: the perils of his isolated childhood, his severe bout of chronic fatigue syndrome, his interest in ecstatic collective experiences – and we barely scratched the surface. 
He’s written six books:

Lecture: Biblical Series XIV: Jacob: Wrestling with God,2017-11-28T01:45:42Z,PT2H32M9S,1667830,24357,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Watch Exodus available exclusively on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3UgQLe6

In this lecture, I present the second half of the story of Jacob, later Israel (he who struggles with God). After serving his time with his uncle Laban, and being deceived by him in the most karmic of manners, Jacob returns to his home country. On the way, he encounters an angel, or God Himself,  wrestles through the night with Him. Successful in his encounter, he still sustains damage to his thigh, but earns the name Israel, and becomes the father of all those who to this day wrestle with God.

I have been working on a new book for about five years. In this video, I talk about the background of 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, and read a subsection from Rule 3: Make Friends with People Who Want The Best For You. It's about the small northern town where I grew up, and the friends I made and lost there.  The discussion also serves as a good introduction to the material you can find on my YouTube channel. 

Boulder Scene: the incomparable Buster Keaton, who did all his own stunts. Seven Chances (1925) with Buster Keaton.  I only extracted a a short clip. The entire chase scene, which involves, among other stunts, Keaton riding a motorbike while sitting on the handles, is among the best ever filmed.

I was invited by the Center for the Study of Liberal Democracy (https://csld.wisc.edu/), and would like to thank them for that. In this talk, I tried to marry my objections to ideology (particularly the radical leftist ideology that is currently dominant in the humanities and, to a lesser degree, the social sciences) and to explain how ideologies parasitize the cognitive structures and symbolic language that characterize truly archetypal and complete world representation.

Dr. Haidt is Professor of Ethical Leadership at New York University's Stern School of Business and a social psychologist. He studies the psychology of morality and the moral emotions. He has been described as a top global thinker by both Foreign Policy and Prospect magazines. Dr. Haidt is the author of three books:

"Intersectionality, individuality and the hero: a discussion with Jonathan Pageau",2017-11-14T17:31:10Z,PT1H5M18S,157095,3942,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"I woke up at about five thirty this morning to a flood of ideas dealing with the emergence of what has been called ""intersectionality"" in the postmodern/identity politics world. Intersectionality is a movement based on the observation that the standard identity groups (race and gender, for example) don't sufficiently capture the variability in oppression that characterizes those who fit into both categories simultaneously (say, black woman). I realized that the intersection of six or more categories of variation (depending on the degree of differentiation) would produce ""groups"" of only one individual. In that manner, the idea of the individual is necessarily making its comeback in the ideologies of collectivism that characterize so much modern thinking. It's an inversion, an indication of our upside down world. Many more ideas came along with that one, some associated with the idea of categorization and the ideal (in a religious and symbolic sense). I decided to contact Jonathan Pageau, who is the embodied intersection of French Canadian, artist, orthodox icon carver, male, expert on postmodernism, and bearded, as I couldn't easily think of anyone else to talk to about such things.

I didn't edit it at all....

I wanted to delve more deeply into the ideology on the radical side of the leftist spectrum, and to specifically address the idea of white privilege. Hopefully that's what I did.

The broad topic for the day (which also included, among others, Theryn Meyer, Jonathan Pageau and Bret Weinstein) was The New Media: Where it is, Where it's Going, and What that Might Mean for All of US. 

I talked about my media experiences from my days with TVO's The Agenda and Big Ideas, as well as the consequences of the video lectures I began to place on YouTube beginning in 2013. Part personal reflection and history, part on-the-fly cultural commentary, this talk is my attempt to come to terms with the new Gutenberg revolution for video and the spoken word.

Update: Law Society of Ontario Compelled Speech,2017-11-02T15:52:42Z,PT1H2M19S,61796,2150,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"The Canadian Constitution Foundation is challenging this in court: http://www.noforcedspeech.ca/

On October 10, Professor Bruce Pardy, Lawyer Jared Brown and I uploaded the video A Call to Rebellion for Ontario Legal Professionals:  (http://bit.ly/2yo4Jpe) in the wake of the Law Society's new requirement for a mandatory ""statement of principles"" that appears primarily political in nature. We believe that this sets an ominous precedent, and that such demands, if accepted unchallenged by Canadian lawyers, will quickly spread to the other professional colleges and organizations in Canada and beyond.

This video discussion is an update on what has happened since. Many articles have been written about these demands:

Here is a summary of the relevant issues:

Recently, the Law Society of Upper Canada (Ontario) has made major revisions to their requirements for the annual submission for legal practitioners in that province. As part of a five-part strategic program known as “Accelerating Culture Shift,” all lawyers are now required to write, submit and abide by a ""Statement of Principles."" The details can be viewed here https://www.lsuc.on.ca/EDI/ -- a site which indicates what lawyers now need to “KNOW AND DO” (caps in the original) for 2017. 

The content of the now-mandatory “Statement of Principles” has been dictated and will be reviewed for compliance by the Law Society itself: Acknowledgement of the “obligation to promote equality, diversity and inclusion generally, and in… behavior towards colleagues, employees, clients and the public.” This is part of a broader claim by the same society of systemic racism endemic in the legal profession in Ontario – a claim for which very little credible evidence has been collected and distributed. 

Furthermore, the Society now requires every legal workplace of 10 or more licensees to “develop, implement and maintain a human rights/diversity policy” and to undergo an “equality, diversity and inclusion self-assessment for their legal workplace, to be provided to the Law Society"" (which will also “encourage legal workplaces to conduct inclusion surveys by providing them with sample templates.”)

Failure to do comply brings with it the threat of serious penalties, including reputational damage and, more seriously, loss of the right to practice. 

By implementing such requirements the Law Society has shifted from an organization ensuring competent practice to one dedicated to policing political and philosophical attitude and behavior. This is a clear and egregious example of compelled speech, and should be rejected as unacceptable by those at whom it is aimed.

Ayaan Hirsi Ali: Islam--Mecca vs Medina?,2017-10-16T21:05:15Z,PT44M17S,245834,7740,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"We discuss Ayaan Hirsi Ali’s recent paper for the Hoover Institute, The Challenge of Dawa (http://hvr.co/2xLuz6e), her conceptualization of Mecca vs Medina Islam (roughly the distinction between peaceful and militarized/expansionist), and the possibility of rapprochement between Islam and the JudeoChristian world. 

We turn from that to the role the Saudis play in accommodating their radical Wahhabi clergy-- propagandizing and destabilizing Western and Islamic societies alike. Like Qatar, Kuwait and Iran, the Saudis are waging a long-term ideological war against the West, which we are too arrogant and too naïve to take seriously. 

We also discuss the failure of Western women to stand up and demand that the denial of women’s rights and restrictions of freedoms that characterize those countries come to a halt—or at least that they demand that our political leaders consider that issue of utmost international importance. 

Ali notes that Western feminists, in their obsession with European patriarchy, refuse to discuss the issues of oppression of women by non-European men outside of the West, and accept the doctrines of multi-culturalism and cultural relativism (and that such acceptance is a catastrophic for women internationally). In consequence, regarding them as more committed to their world-view than the rights of genuinely oppressed women in many non-Western countries, she does not consider them feminists at all. 

Ayaan Hirsi Ali is the author of four books, The Caged Virgin (2004) (http://amzn.to/2xLH168), the autobiographical Infidel (2006) (http://amzn.to/2gIQVuH) and Nomad (2011) (http://amzn.to/2xJWWgk), and her latest (2015) Heretic: Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now (http://amzn.to/2glwkQ2).

A Call to Rebellion for Ontario Legal Professionals,2017-10-10T15:32:53Z,PT47M6S,130937,4976,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Ontario lawyers/paralegals: Indicate your objection to the Law Society demands (confidentiality ensured) at http://bit.ly/2xuZKOj. Please forward this video URL to your colleagues. 

Concerned non-lawyers, please contact the Law Society at:  lawsociety@lsuc.on.ca  

(It can be difficult for individual lawyers to stand up against such unwarranted intrusion singly. In consequence, we established the website to generate an estimate of the degree of dissatisfaction and resistance. The number of signatories will be made public, on that same website, within the first week--and updated regularly--but no personally identifying details will be released. ) 

Summary: Recently, the Law Society of Upper Canada (Ontario) has made major revisions to their requirements for the annual submission for legal practitioners in that province. As part of a five-part strategic program known as “Accelerating Culture Shift,” all lawyers are now required to write, submit and abide by a ""Statement of Principles."" The details can be viewed here https://www.lsuc.on.ca/EDI/ -- a site which indicates what lawyers now need to “KNOW AND DO” (caps in the original) for 2017. 

In this video, I discuss this new demand (enforced by the power of government and law) with practicing lawyer Jared Brown and Professor Bruce Pardy of Queen’s University, both of whom testified, along with me, last year at the Canadian Senate on the compelled speech required by federal Bill C-16. 

The content of the now-mandatory “Statement of Principles” has been dictated and will be reviewed for compliance by the Law Society itself: Acknowledgement of the “obligation to promote equality, diversity and inclusion generally, and in… behavior towards colleagues, employees, clients and the public.” This is part of a broader claim by the same society of systemic racism endemic in the legal profession in Ontario – a claim for which very little credible evidence has been collected and distributed. 

Furthermore, the Society now requires every legal workplace of 10 or more licensees to “develop, implement and maintain a human rights/diversity policy” and to undergo an “equality, diversity and inclusion self-assessment for their legal workplace, to be provided to the Law Society"" (which will also “encourage legal workplaces to conduct inclusion surveys by providing them with sample templates.”)

This video describes a personality assessment and reporting system we have been working on for several years. 

We launched it this week.

We believe it provides the most detailed, comprehensive description of individual personality currently available, covering the Big 5 primary traits and their 10 associated aspects:

Extraversion: Assertiveness & Enthusiasm
Neuroticism: Withdrawal & Volatility
Agreeableness: Compassion & Politeness
Conscientiousness: Industriousness & Orderliness
Openness to Experience: Openness (creativity) & Intellect (interest in ideas)

This video also reviews our previous psychological intervention, www.selfauthoring.com, describing what it is and how it can be used to improve personal traits and behaviors.

We hope you find these online projects intellectually compelling and practically useful.

Modern Times: Camille Paglia & Jordan B Peterson,2017-10-02T23:44:33Z,PT1H42M48S,3574143,96211,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Dr. Camille Paglia is a well-known American intellectual and social critic. She has been a professor at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (where this discussion took place) since 1984. She is the author of seven books focusing on literature, visual art, music, and film history, among other topics. The most well-known of these is Sexual Personae (http://amzn.to/2xVGEEV), an expansion of her highly original doctoral thesis at Yale. The newest, Free Women, Free Men:  Sex, Gender, Feminism, was published by Pantheon Books in March 2017 (http://amzn.to/2hGycTG). 
 
Dr. Paglia has been warning about the decline and corruption of the modern humanities for decades, and she is a serious critic of the postmodern ethos that currently dominates much of academia. Although she is a committed equity feminist, she firmly opposes the victim/oppressor narrative that dominates much of modern American and British feminism. 
 
In this wide-ranging discussion, we cover (among other topics) the pernicious influence of the French intellectuals of the 1970's on the American academy, the symbolic utility of religious tradition, the tendency toward intellectual conformity and linguistic camouflage among university careerists, the under-utilization of Carl Jung and his student, Erich Neumann, in literary criticism and the study of the humanities, and the demolition of the traditional roles and identity of men and women in the West. 
 
A Facebook page is maintained for Dr. Paglia by Pantheon at Penguin Random House in New York: https://www.facebook.com/CamillePagliaAuthor

The Neuroscience of Intelligence: Dr. Richard Haier,2017-09-04T19:46:46Z,PT1H24M21S,473504,11639,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"There is almost nothing more important to understand about people than intelligence. It can be measured more accurately than anything else in the social sciences. It differs tremendously and importantly between individuals. It is the single most important determinant of life success. It's very existence, however, remains subject to substantive debate, most of it highly politicized. 

Dr. Richard Haier has recently written a major book on the topic, The Neuroscience of Intelligence (http://amzn.to/2em55A9), summarized in the following manner: ""This book introduces new and provocative neuroscience research that advances our understanding of intelligence and the brain. Compelling evidence shows that genetics plays a more important role than environment as intelligence develops from childhood, and that intelligence test scores correspond strongly to specific features of the brain assessed with neuroimaging. In understandable language, Richard J. Haier explains cutting-edge techniques based on genetics, DNA, and imaging of brain connectivity and function. He dispels common misconceptions, such as the belief that IQ tests are biased or meaningless, and debunks simple interventions alleged to increase intelligence. ""

We recently spent an hour and a half talking about such things. 

For more information about Dr. Haier, see: http://www.richardhaier.com/

Lecture: Biblical Series XII: The Great Sacrifice: Abraham and Isaac,2017-08-19T18:57:45Z,PT2H33M32S,1225347,21682,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Watch Exodus available exclusively on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3UgQLe6

In this, the final lecture of the Summer 2017 12-part series The Psychological Significance of the Biblical Stories,  we encounter, first, Hagar's banishment to the desert with Ishmael and then the demand made by God to Abraham for the sacrifice of Isaac.

To sacrifice now is to gain later: perhaps the greatest of human discoveries. What, then, should best be sacrificed? And what might be the greatest gain? There are few eternal questions more profound and difficult.

In this lecture, I read an excerpt from Chapter 7 of my new book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, now available for pre-order at Amazon.ca (http://amzn.to/2wkb7MY) and Amazon.com (http://amzn.to/2x1hfXF). 

I am currently making arrangements to continue this series with a monthly lecture. That will start in September at a date and time yet to be announced.

Postmodernism: History and Diagnosis....,2017-08-18T15:15:37Z,PT1H27M12S,380981,9017,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"On August 17, I spoke with Dr. Stephen Hicks (http://www.stephenhicks.org/), professor in the philosophy department at Rockford University. Dr. Hicks is the author of the influential and courageous 2004 book Explaining Postmodernism: Skepticism and Socialism from Rousseau to Foucault, which is perhaps even more relevant and important now than it was when it was published. 

We spoke in depth about the history of philosophy as it has developed since medieval times, trying to understand and describe the processes that led to the rise of postmodern theory.

The book itself can be purchased here at Amazon: http://amzn.to/2icI7k1. Dr. Hicks has also made it available in pdf form here: http://www.stephenhicks.org/explaining-postmodernism/. A useful review/overview, written by Dr. Steven Sanders, can be found here: http://bit.ly/2icHret. An audiobook also exists, and can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQcNjHNXnEE

Why is this all relevant? Because our culture finds itself currently embroiled in a war of ideas, and those ideas must be understood.

Lecture: Biblical Series XI: Sodom and Gomorrah,2017-08-14T02:13:04Z,PT2H31M,2425212,35568,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Watch Exodus available exclusively on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3UgQLe6

Often interpreted as an injunction against homosexuality (particularly by those simultaneously claiming identity as Christians and opposed to that orientation), the stories of the angels who visit Abraham, bless him, and then rain destruction on Sodom and Gomorrah are more truly a warning against mistreatment of the stranger and impulsive, dysregulated, sybaritic conduct.

Abraham opens his heart and hearth to the stranger. The denizens of Lot’s soon-to-be lost cities threaten them with violent rape. God exacts a terrible retribution. The warning is clear.

2017/08/08: James Damore and his Google Memo on Diversity  (complete),2017-08-09T15:03:47Z,PT51M10S,650457,25025,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"James Damore of Google recently wrote a memo detailing his thoughts about Google's diversity initiatives. Within a month, it went viral, and he was fired, for ""perpetuating gender stereotypes."" The problem is that everything James claimed is solidly backed by well-developed scientific literatures. Thus, the company in charge of much of the world's communication has now fired an excellent engineer for citing established scientific truths. 

In this full 50 min interview, James and I discuss his motivations, and the consequences of his actions. We are joined (audio only) by another Google employee who wishes, for obvious reasons, to remain anonymous. 

A fund-raiser for James has been established, here:

de Bruyn (2012): http://bit.ly/2uoWkMh

To quote de Bruyn et al: high status predicts more mating opportunities and, thus, increased reproductive success. “This is true for human adults in many cultures, both ‘modern’ as well as ‘primitive’ (Betzig, 1986). In fact, this theory seems to be confirmed for non-human primates (Cheney, 1983; Cowlishaw and Dunbar, 1991; Dewsbury, 1982; Gray, 1985; Maslow, 1936) and other animals from widely differing ecologies (Ellis, 1995) such as squirrels (Farentinos, 1972), cockerels (Kratzer and Craig, 1980), and cockroaches (Breed, Smith, and Gall, 1980).” Status also increases female reproductive success, via a different pathway: “For females, it is generally argued that dominance is not necessarily a path to more copulations, as it is for males. It appears that important benefits bestowed upon dominant women are access to resources and less harassment from rivals (Campbell, 2002). Thus, dominant females tend to have higher offspring survival rates, at least among simians (Pusey, Williams, and Goodall, 1997); thus, dominance among females also appears to be linked to reproductive success.”

Lecture: Biblical Series X: Abraham: Father of Nations,2017-08-08T12:57:59Z,PT2H28M21S,1596538,25913,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Watch Exodus available exclusively on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3UgQLe6

The Abrahamic adventures continue with this, the tenth lecture in my 12-part initial Biblical lecture series. Abraham's life is presented as a series of encapsulated narratives, punctuated by sacrifice, and the rekindling of his covenant with God. This seems to reflect the pattern of human life: the journey towards a goal, or destination, and the completion of a stage or epoch of life, followed by the necessity of revaluation and reconsideration of identity, prior to the next step forward. Abraham, for his part, makes the sacrifices necessary to continue to walk with God, or before God (as the terminology in this section has it). It is this decision that allows him to transcend the vicissitudes of life, and to take his role as the father of nations.

In this lecture, I tell the story of Abraham, who heeds the call of God to leave what was familiar behind and to journey into unknown lands. The man portrayed in the Bible as the father of nations moves forward into the world. He encounters the worst of nature (famine), society (the tyranny of Egypt) and the envy of the powerful, who desire his wife. There is nothing easy about Abraham's life. Instead, he is portrayed both as a real man, with serious problems, and a hero, who overcomes tremendous obstacles to establish himself in the world.

His covenant with God is an Ark. His decision to aim at the highest good he can conceptualize places an aura of magic around the events of his life, despite their harshness. He's a model for life in the world as it is, not as we wish it would be.

In the next series of stories, the Biblical patriarch Abram (later: Abraham) enters into a covenant with God. The history of Israel proper begins with these stories. Abram heeds the call to adventure, journeys courageously away from his country and family into the foreign and unknown, encounters the disasters of nature and the tyranny of mankind and maintains his relationship with the God who has sent him forth.  He becomes in this manner a light in the world, and a father of nations. 
How is this all to be understood? I am attempting in this lecture to determine precisely that. How are we, as modern people, to make sense of the idea of the God who reveals himself to a personality? How can we relate the details of the Abramic stories to our own lives, in the current world? In what frame of reference can these stories be seen to make sense, and to reveal their meaning?

2017/05/13: Freedom of Speech: Not Just Another Value,2017-07-24T03:55:54Z,PT1H45M52S,275899,7978,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"I was invited to address the Annual General Meeting of the Canadian Society for Academic Freedom (http://www.safs.ca/) on May 13, 2017. Dr. Marc Mercer, President of SAF, and professor in the Department of Philosophy of Halifax's St. Mary's University introduced me. 

I would like to thank SAF for their support over the last year.

This talk focuses on the reasons that the right to free speech must be considered in some sense paramount among the intrinsic rights, rather than merely one value among many. There is no difference between free speech and free thought, for starters, and without free thought it is impossible to know oneself or the world.

"Lecture VIII Background: Abrahamic Stories, with Matthieu & Jonathan Pageau",2017-07-19T12:29:30Z,PT1H25M17S,556825,9540,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Watch Exodus available exclusively on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3UgQLe6

I had this 90 minute discussion with Jonathan Pageau, carver of Orthodox icons (http://www.pageaucarvings.com/index.html) and YouTube broadcaster (https://www.youtube.com/user/pageaujonathan), as well as his brother Matthieu, who  recently finished a draft of a book on the bible. I did so as part of the background research I was doing for the 8th lecture in my series The Psychological Significance of the Biblical Stories. We talked about the nature of the narrative landscape of the Bible, focusing on the Abrahamic stories, which constitute the subject material for that 8th and other forthcoming lectures.

Lecture: Biblical Series VII: Walking with God: Noah and the Flood,2017-07-19T00:33:02Z,PT2H32M21S,1891132,29660,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Watch Exodus available exclusively on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3UgQLe6

Life at the individual and the societal level is punctuated by crisis and catastrophe. This stark truth finds its narrative representation in the widely-distributed universal motif of the flood. Mircea Eliade, the great Romanian historian of religion, noted that flood stories identify two reasons for the destruction: (1) the tendency of complex things to fall apart of their own accord; (2) the proclivity of human beings to speed up that process by sinning, or missing the mark (by engaging in self-evident corruption, or by failing to attend to what cries out for attention). The Genesis story clearly states that Noah and his family are to be spared from impending disaster because Noah “walks with God,” as Adam did before the Fall. In this lecture, the 7th in the series, I intermingle the story of Noah and his survival with elements of the Sermon on the Mount, making the effort to explain to a modern audience why careful moral attitude and behavior comprises the best defence against “the righteous anger of God.”

2017/06/28: Postmodern NeoMarxism: Diagnosis and Cure,2017-07-10T01:00:03Z,PT33M20S,285911,11345,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"I gave this talk at a meeting hosted by the University of Toronto's Students in Support of Free Speech (https://www.facebook.com/ssfsut/), which is one of many such groups that are springing up across North American, Europe, Australia and New Zealand in reaction to the censorial attitude of the postmodern neo-marxists who have come to dominate the humanities, law, education and much of the social sciences on campuses in recent years.

I am hoping that with concerted effort it will be possible to identify the corrupted and ideologically-possessed university disciplines across campuses world-wide and to drive down their new enrolment by 75% over the next five years. 

As of now a website is being designed to help students (and their parents) identify postmodern cult courses from course descriptions, so that those who would rather be educated than indoctrinated can make a choice (and, I suppose, for those who wish the opposite to make a choice as well). Stay posted.

Lecture: Biblical Series VI: The Psychology of the Flood,2017-07-03T14:25:39Z,PT2H35M58S,2687168,36241,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Watch Exodus available exclusively on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3UgQLe6

The story of Noah and the Ark is next in the Genesis sequence. This is a more elaborated tale than the initial creation account, or the story of Adam and Eve or Cain and Abel. However, it cannot be understood in its true depth without some investigation into what the motif of the flood means, psychologically, and an analysis of how that motif is informed by the order/chaos dichotomy, as well as by the idea of an involuntary voyage to the underworld or confrontation with the dragon. In consequence, this lecture concentrates almost exclusively on psychology: How is an encounter with the unknown to be understood, conceptually? How and why is that represented with themes such as the underworld voyage, the dragon fight, or the flood? 

All that constitutes the theme of lecture VI.

Bible Series V: Cain and Abel: The Hostile Brothers

The account of Cain and Abel is remarkable for its unique combination of brevity and depth. In a few short sentences, it outlines two diametrically opposed modes of being -- both responses to the emergence of self-consciousness and the knowledge of good and evil detailed in story of Adam and Eve. 

Cain's mode of being -- resentful, arrogant and murderous -- arises because his sacrifices are rejected by God. This means that his attempts to give up something valuable in the present to ensure prosperity in the future are insufficient. He fails, in consequence, to thrive, as he believes he should, and becomes bitter, resentful and murderous.

Abel's mode of being is characterized, by contrast, by proper sacrifice -- by the establishment of balance between present action and future benefit. This ensures his personal and social success, accruing over time. Unfortunately, it also makes him the target of Cain's malevolence.

This great short story is relevant personally, on the level of the family, and politically, all with equal force, all simultaneously.

2017/06/15: 12 principles for a 21st century conservatism,2017-06-22T14:56:19Z,PT2H1M51S,902831,20764,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Conservatism has all-too-often found itself unable to articulate a coherent positive doctrine. By this I mean specifically that the laudable conservative tendency to preserve the best of past has too-often manifested itself in a series of ""thou shalt not"" statements, instead of laying out a manifesto of fundamental values that might serve to unite people around a set of common ambitions. I am attempting to rectify this problem with this statement of principles, some of which I believe might have the additional virtue of being attractive to young people, looking for mature and forthright purpose and responsibility. 
I am not making the claim that the statement is perfect, comprehensive or final.
Background to the talk: 
I spoke at Carleton Place, a town in Lanark County, Thursday, June 15/17. I was invited by Randy Hillier, who is a Member of Provincial Parliament for Ontario (randyhilliermpp.com).  You can find out more about him here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Hillier_(politician)

Tenets of a viable 21st century conservatism

1. The fundamental assumptions of Western civilization are valid.

2. Peaceful social being is preferable to isolation and to war. In consequence, it justly and rightly demands some sacrifice of individual impulse and idiosyncrasy.

3. Hierarchies of competence are desirable and should be promoted. 

4. Borders are reasonable. Likewise, limits on immigration are reasonable. Furthermore, it should not be assumed that citizens of societies that have not evolved functional individual-rights predicated polities will hold values in keeping with such polities.
5. People should be paid so that they are able and willing to perform socially useful and desirable duties. 

6. Citizens have the inalienable right to benefit from the result of their own honest labor.

7. It is more noble to teach young people about responsibilities than about rights. 

8. It is better to do what everyone has always done, unless you have some extraordinarily valid reason to do otherwise.

9. Radical change should be viewed with suspicion, particularly in a time of radical change.

10. The government, local and distal, should leave people to their own devices as much as possible.

11. Intact heterosexual two-parent families constitute the necessary bedrock for a stable polity. 

12. We should judge our political system in comparison to other actual political systems and not to hypothetical utopias.

I turned my attention in this lecture to the older of the two creation accounts in Genesis: the story of Adam and Eve. In its few short paragraphs, it covers:

1. the emergence of human self-consciousness; 
2. mankind's attendant realization of vulnerability, mortality, and death; 
3. the origin of the capacity for willful evil, as the ability to exploit that newly-realized vulnerability;
4. the emergence of shame as a consequence of that realization;
5. the shrinking from divine destiny that occurred when shame emerged; and
6. the beginning of true history, with the self-conscious toil that life in history entails.

Impossible. Amazing. Breathtaking. 

The only story that can perhaps match it in terms of impact per sentence is that of Cain and Abel, which we discuss in the next lecture: number five in this twelve part series.

Human beings are information foragers, evolved to live on the border between explored and unexplored territory, order and chaos and, symbolically, ying and yang. That's where information flow is maximized, and the meaning that helps buttress us against tragedy is to be found.

Although I thought I might get to Genesis II in this third lecture, and begin talking about Adam & Eve, it didn't turn out that way. There was more to be said about the idea of God as creator (with the Word as the process underlying the act of creation). I didn't mind, because it is very important to get God and the Creation of the Universe right before moving on  :)  .

In this lecture, I tried to outline something like this: for anything to be, there has to be a substrate (call it a potential) from which it emerges, a structure that provides the possibility of imposing order on that substrate, and the act of ordering, itself. So the first is something like the precosmogonic chaos (implicitly feminine); the second, God the Father; the third, what the Christian West has portrayed as the Son (the Word of Truth).

2017 Personality 21: Biology & Traits: Performance Prediction,2017-06-04T21:22:03Z,PT1H28M31S,572839,13074,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"In this lecture, I talk about the thorny problem of predicting performance: academic, industrial, creative and entrepreneurial); about the practical utility of such prediction, in the business and other environments; about the economic value of accurate prediction (in hiring, placement and promotion) -- which is incredibly high. 

Intelligence (psychometrically measured IQ) is the best predictor of performance in complex, ever changing environments. Conscientiousness is the (next) best predictor, particularly in the military, in school and in conservative businesses. Agreeable people make better caretakers; disagreeable people, better disciplinarians and negotiators (within reasonable bounds). Open people are artistic, creative and entrepreneurial. Extraverts are good socially. Introverts work well in isolation. People low in neuroticism have higher levels of tolerance for stress (but may be less sensitive to real signs of danger). 

Match the career you pursue to your temperament, rather than trying to adjust the latter. Although some adjustment is possible, there are powerful biological determinants of the five personality dimensions and IQ (particularly in environments where differences are allowed to flourish).

Thanks very much to all 3500 of my Patreon supporters. As I described in this video, I plan to put the monetary support to good use. 
First, the Biblical series (you can find the first two, soon to be three, lectures on this youtube channel). 
Second, a discussion series with Islamic thinkers about the relationship between Islam and the West. 
Third, my longer-term plans to make classic humanities education available world-wide. 
Fourth, my work with my business partners on developing online software (like that at selfauthoring.com) to teach people how to write well -- and, at the same time (because it's the same thing), how to think. 
Fifth, the development and implementation of a plan to accredit people properly for the university-level education that they will soon be able to receive online.

That's a good start. Thanks to all of you for increasing its probability, and for the support, psychological, practical and monetary.

Over and out.

Lecture II in my Psychological Significance of the Biblical Stories from May 23 at Isabel Bader Theatre, Toronto. In this lecture, I present Genesis 1, which presents the idea that a pre-existent cognitive structure (God the Father) uses the Logos, the Christian Word, the Second Person of the Trinity, to generate habitable order out of pre-cosmogonic chaos at the beginning of time. It is in that Image that Man and Woman are created -- indicating, perhaps, that it is (1) through speech that we participate in the creation of the cosmos of experience and (2) that what true speech creates is good. 

It is a predicate of Western culture that each individual partakes in some manner in the divine. This is the true significance of consciousness, which has a world-creating aspect.

2017 Maps of Meaning 12: Final: The Divinity of the Individual,2017-05-27T14:53:37Z,PT2H25M56S,744600,13827,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"In this, the final Maps of Meaning lecture for 2017, I review the year and its offerings: What is a belief system? Why are people so inclined to engage in conflict to protect their belief systems?

It's partly because our belief systems are not only systems of belief, but structures that serve to render everyone who participates in that belief and its dramatization and acting out in the world predictable, trustworthy and cooperative (even when competing). 

Is there a hierarchy of rank or value among belief systems, or are they merely arbitrary? 

What is the relationship between descriptions of the objective world and moral guidelines? How do you determine how to conduct yourself in the world? What should you do (and is that question even genuine -- or answerable?) 

What inbuilt structures do you bring into the world, as a consequence of biological evolution, that help you orient yourself in life, in the face of its overwhelming complexity? What is the relationship between the games that children learn to play when becoming socialized and the cultural structures that guide us in broader society? How is all this related to the underlying symbolic structures (religious structures) that sit at the base of our societies and belief structures?

2017/04/21: A Left-Wing Case for Free Speech,2017-05-24T23:21:46Z,PT2H11M22S,129256,3344,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"A few weeks ago, I went to Vancouver and delivered two talks. This is the first. I felt that it would be useful to make a case, from a left-wing perspective, for the primacy of free speech, in the pursuit of avowedly left-wing goals. Free speech is an issue of such primary importance for the maintenance of our culture that it is foolish to assume that it is somehow naturally allied only with centrist or right-wing political agendas. In fact, I think a case can be made that such freedom is even more important for the genuine left (a political movement or position that can validly speak for the relatively powerless) than for partisans of any other position.

So I made that case in this address. Thanks to Angelo Isodorou (and Theryn Meyer) and their teams for setting this up.

Baron Media also posted this lecture: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw5oIomZRnc

Note: The audio was damaged for the first minute of this talk, so I had to re-record that intro section, reconstructing it as well as I could from memory.

2017/04/10: Six Minutes on the True Purpose of University Education,2017-05-23T15:31:42Z,PT6M20S,190882,9443,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"I recently spoke at Harvard University, in interview format, on the topic: Mask of Compassion:  Post-Modernism & Neo-Marxism. This is a five minute clip from that talk (available in full at http://bit.ly/2qKZTwS) on the true purpose of university education.

Educate yourself. Become articulate -- able to think, form arguments, act and lead. Transcend your ignorance and victimhood. Reduce the suffering in the world. Lead a heroic life. 

That's the purpose of any university education worthy of the term.

There was a fair bit of controversy surrounding the invitation (which accounted in part for the relatively confrontational tone of the interview/discussion). There were protesters in attendance, one of whom insisted (as is quite common) in speaking out of turn, because, of course, her comments were so important that putting them forward justified breaking the agreed-upon rules. That said, the protesters were civil.

Lecture: Biblical Series I: Introduction to the Idea of God,2017-05-20T21:36:39Z,PT2H38M28S,13093792,218336,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Watch Exodus available exclusively on DailyWire+: https://bit.ly/3UgQLe6

Lecture I in my Psychological Significance of the Biblical Stories series from May 16th at Isabel Bader Theatre in Toronto. In this lecture, I describe what I consider to be the idea of God, which is at least partly the notion of sovereignty and power, divorced from any concrete sovereign or particular, individual person of power. I also suggest that God, as Father, is something akin to the spirit or pattern inherent in the human hierarchy of authority, which is based in turn on the dominance hierarchies characterizing animals.

2017/05/17: Senate hearing on Bill C16,2017-05-18T17:31:40Z,PT1H9S,2273734,56320,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Update: on May 18, C16 sailed through the Canadian Senate with no amendments. 

I served as a witness at the Canadian Senate yesterday, regarding Bill C16, which adds the ill-defined categories of gender expression and gender identity to the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination. The Federal government, in a website which has since been taken down, stated clearly that this legislation would be interpreted in keeping with the policies of the Ontario Human Rights Commission, which I regard as one of the most dangerous institutions in Canada, in relationship to all rights other than those of ""equality,"" including freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of association. I was partnered with lawyer Jared Brown, whose courageous and detailed analysis of Bill C16 can be found here: https://litigationguy.wordpress.com/2016/12/24/bill-c-16-whats-the-big-deal/

Dr. Daly has determined that economic inequality and male on male homicide rates are strongly linked, and makes a causal argument for why this is the case, attributing it to status competition under stressful conditions.

Sounds good? But conscientiousness is partly composed of aspect orderliness, along with industriousness, and orderliness is associated both with disgust and with authoritarianism (particularly among those low in openness to experience). Hitler and the Jews? The Holocaust? Orderliness and disgust sensitivity gone mad.

That campaign (http://bit.ly/2pS0knc) ends in 16 hours, as of 10:30 AM Saturday May 6/17. 

We are studying the personality basis of political belief (including political correctness), among other things, explained briefly in this video. 

Thank you to Mr. Levant and all of the 2500 people who contributed more than $180,000 to this campaign. It is much appreciated and we will do our best to put it to good, practical use.

I also discuss IQ: how it is measured, what it means, how powerfully it predicts long-term life success, as well as the highly skewed Pareto distribution of creative production.

2017/04/24: Banned lecture at Linfield College: Ethics and Free Speech,2017-05-02T21:13:41Z,PT2H6M24S,331049,8912,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"I was recently invited to speak at Linfield College, McMinnville, Oregon, by the Young Americans for Liberty. The talk had been booked for months, I had my plane tickets and reservations, the hall was ready.... But then the Linfield administration saw fit to disinvite me. So I gave my honorarium to the student group and they rented another venue. 

This video has the invitation letter, my response, and the subsequent talk, entitled Ethics and Free Speech. 

Thanks to YAL for hosting me.

2017/03/09: National Gallery Talk: Creativity -- and Protest,2017-04-30T04:22:57Z,PT5M42S,38687,1308,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"On March 9, 2017, I was invited to speak at the National Gallery of Canada on creativity. There were protests at the Gallery, a letter-writing campaign, petitions, disparaging commentary in local media outlets, and pressure placed on the National Gallery Staff to cancel the event -- which they did not.

See for example: http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/jordan-peterson-national-gallery-canada-1.4005615

This video contains footage from the protest, and then a three-minute segment of the discussion between Marc Meyer, Director of the Gallery, and myself. We spoke before an enthusiastic crowd of about 700 for an hour. About 300 people were turned away for lack of space. 

The rest of the discussion is at the National Gallery of Canada YouTube site here: http://bit.ly/2oTKCpg

Thanks to Marc his staff (who I won't name here) for making this happen.

2017/04/21: Disinvited to Linfield College: My response,2017-04-22T00:15:58Z,PT14M24S,181968,13348,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"In February of 2017, I was invited to speak at Linfield College (http://www.linfield.edu/), a small liberal arts institution in McMinnville, Oregon, about an hour outside of Portland. I agreed, and the talk was scheduled for Monday, April 24. This caused some controversy, as the typical suspects began to express their concern about safe spaces. On April 18, the talk was summarily canceled, despite the flight and accommodation bookings. I gave the host students permission to use my honorarium to book an alternative venue.

It was Susan Agre-Kippenhan, VP Academic Affairs, who made the decision to disinvite me (http://www.linfield.edu/academic-affairs.html)

The President is Dr. Thomas L. Hellie (http://www.linfield.edu/president.html)

If you decide to contact either of these individuals, please articulate your arguments conservatively and carefully. It's intelligence and clarity that will win this battle, and nothing else.

We first talked about protests, YouTube pundits and political correctness. Then we talked about vision and responsibility. I mentioned the work my lab has done with Future Authoring (www.selfauthoring.com; story at NPR: http://n.pr/1TpZIxd) and offered his viewers a discount on the program (see below). 

We closed by discussing fantasy play, pretence and identity,  demonetization and other passive censorship on YouTube, and the upper lifetime limit on pizza consumption.  

Discount code for Future Authoring (selfauthoring.com) is posted in the video description of our talk at SomeBlackGuy's YouTube Channel: http://bit.ly/2o7ZJyb

2017 Personality 17:  Biology and Traits: Agreeableness,2017-03-29T14:36:21Z,PT49M26S,2063500,25456,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"In this lecture, I talk about the Big Five trait agreeableness, which is the dimension of the care system, in Jaak Panksepp's terminology. It can be construed as cooperation vs competition, or compliance vs non-compliance, or tender-mindedness vs tough-mindedness. It is also an important determinant of political belief, being the trait most associated with the body of ideas that has come to be known as politically correct.

Agreeable people tend to view the political world as innocent infant vs reptilian predator. Perhaps this is good for you (although probably not) if you are placed in the innocent infant category, but it is not so good if you are deemed reptilian predator :)

Buy The Gulag Archipelago by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. It is arguably the most important book of the twentieth century.

2017 Maps of Meaning 07: Images of Story & Metastory,2017-03-06T22:12:38Z,PT2H11M51S,783270,13119,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"In this lecture, I discuss how the basic or archetypal categories we use to frame the world are represented in image, where they existed long before their nature could be articulated. These categories include the individual (hero/adversary), culture (wise king/tyrant), and nature (destruction/creation). The heroic individual (the knower) is typically masculine, as is culture (the known), while the unknown is feminine. These categories can be conceptualized, as well, as explorer, explored territory, and unexplored territory. The most abstract category is the dragon of chaos, the monster who guards what is most valuable. It is from this most primordial of categories that the other three emerge. Our existence as prey and predator is reflected in the ambivalent representation of the absolute unknown.

Dialogue: Great U Texas Austin Psych Prof JW Pennebaker,2017-03-04T17:03:19Z,PT1H21M9S,169192,3017,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Podcast: http://jordanbpeterson.com/2017/03/episode-11/

Dr. James W. Pennebaker is Professor of Psychology at the University of Texas at Austin, and the Executive Director of Project 2021, aimed at rethinking undergrad education at that university.

I first encountered Dr. Pennebaker's work when I was working  on the SelfAuthoring Suite (www.selfauthoring.com), an online writing program which has helped thousands of college students stay in school and get better grades. He conducted the original work on ""expressive writing,"" starting in the 1980's, showing that people's health and productivity improved when they wrote about traumatic experiences or uncertainty -- particularly if they constructed causal accounts or plans. He has also investigated the psychological significance of patterns of word use (particularly about everyone's favorites, pronouns). We talk about all of this, and much more.

Dr. Pennebaker's books include:

""Opening Up by Writing it Down"" http://amzn.to/2mQX09L
""Expressive Writing: Words that Heal"" http://amzn.to/2m6eIWP
""The Secret Life of Pronouns"" http://amzn.to/2lqfRvu

You can find out more about The SelfAuthoring Suite, which helps people write about the difficulties and uncertainties of the past (Past Authoring), present (Present Authoring) and Future (Future Authoring) at www.selfauthoring.com. NPR did a popular story on the suite: The Writing Assignment that Changes Lives: http://n.pr/1TpZIxd

The phenomenologists were attempting to to reduce the painful separation between object and subject that has as one of its consequence the elimination of meaning from existence.

We frame the world -- or the world reveals itself to us -- as a story, with a starting point, a destination, and the behavioral means to move from one to the other. The destination is valued more highly than the starting point, and constitutes the point of the story -- the aim of the individual. Reality manifests itself within that story as what is relevant for forward movement, what gets in the way, and what is irrelevant and can be safely ignored. The largest category, by far, is the latter. Unfortunately, sometimes what has been happily classified as irrelevant rears up and gets in the way. That's a manifestation of chaos. Chaos can undermine the story, or break the frame. The degree of undermining or breakage is proportional to the time and space over which the story in question extends its operations.

These inhabited stories are predicated on an underlying value system (as we must want to be where we are going more than we value where we are). In addition, they are frames of reference, allowing us to perceive (things that move us along; things that get in our way), make most of the world irrelevant (things that have no bearing on our current frame), and determine emotional significance (positive: things that move us along; negative: things that get in our way).

Professor Bruce Pardy (http://bit.ly/2ljWlMB) spoke in support of the law and its accompanying policies. SPOILER ALERT: The Runnymede society approached six different law school professors, trying to find someone who would debate me, without success. Professor Pardy played devil's advocate.

The basic structure is order/paradise, chaos/the fall, re-establishment of order/paradise. Since all paradises fall, however, the true paradise is identification with the process of transformation itself.

An open letter to Sam Harris,2017-01-22T02:51:51Z,PT7M37S,291954,7841,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Dr. Sam Harris and I recently had a discussion: https://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/what-is-true. We hit an impasse over the definition of truth. I don't think we got to where we should have, and I think the listeners felt that. So in this video (I also sent the letter to Dr. Harris) I try to sort some of that out, try to make what I was claiming clearer, and suggest what we might do instead.

Thanks to Luis Guillermo Martinez Pinzon for the intro animation and splash screen. Much appreciated.

What is belief? Why is it so important to people? Why will they fight to protect it? I propose that belief unites a culture's expectations and desires with the actions of its people, and that the match between those two allows for cooperative action and maintains emotional stability. I suggest, further, that culture has a deep narrative structure, presenting the world as a forum for action, with characters representing the individual, the known, and the unknown -- or the individual, culture and nature -- or the individual, order and chaos.

Lord Black underestimates the seriousness of the law, because of the absurdity of the issue. That's an error. I explain why. In addition, I read a legal opinion on the matter, indicating that my caution about the dangerous of imprisonment for violating Bill C-16 and its associated legislation is far from unjustified. Canadians, pay attention and beware -- and the rest of the world, too. 

Legal opinion: D. Jared Brown

Here's a paper I wrote a few years ago that discusses how to operate in the spaces between categories: It's called Peacemaking Among Higher Order Primates -- a tongue in cheek title: http://bit.ly/2gEPwGD

Jonathan Pageau is a Quebecois artist, a carver of Russian Orthodox icons, and a sculptor. He's touched with more than a bit of genius, and has deep knowledge of archetype and symbolism. In this video, which is Part I of II, we discuss art, tradition, and the strange and unsettling things that exist between categories.

If you're interested, play it. You can purchase the Pokemon PC sticker starter kit on ebay:

I hope by doing so either to make them drop the requirement entirely or, at minimum, to remove the mandatory element. The former would be preferable. 

Note they have not made such training mandatory for the professors.

I also hope to convince people subject to such things to refuse, in writing, and have provided them with arguments in this video that will help them make their case. 

An update: the U of T has a new VP of HR. Her name is Kelly Hannah-Moffat. Her email is hannah.moffat@utoronto.ca. Please contact here about the issues in this video. Do so respectfully and carefully. Assume rationality on her part.

Audio only version available at http://snip.ly/sfzp1

This is a one hour discussion of political correctness. It is the first of a planned three part series on the topic. Part I deals with the fear that PC types are producing, and the profound legal ramifications of their continual activism. Part II is a case study, assessing the PC-ification of the University of Toronto HR department.

Part III is a description of what can be done at the individual level to oppose political correctness and its dangerously totalitarian aspirations. 

Please share this with anyone interested.

It indicates the remarkable density and profundity of his work -- his ability to layer meaning upon meaning in a few sentences.

"Tackling the ""Meaning Crisis"": Mental Chaos in University Students",2016-07-20T18:56:32Z,PT1H42M41S,86113,1603,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"This talk was organized by Blu Matter Project, a University of Toronto student group dedicated to student mental health. The organizers of this event sent me the following statement: 

""Many university students' core beliefs and ideas are challenged by the courses they take, with no meaningful and beneficial replacements being proposed.  This creates a devastating problem for many students. They experience a crisis of meaning, and no longer know or can't tell what they should pursue in life. This existential undermining adds to the stress students experience while attempting to maintain a good GPA and manage demanding courses. All of this can produce depression, and encourage a nihilistic outlook."" 

This discussion addresses such issues.

The commonalities include the idea of a paradisal, enclosed space; the disruption of that space by anomalies associated with mortality; and, in the final analysis, the idea of enlightenment or identification with the divine as medication for tragic self-consciousness.

2016 Personality Lecture 13: Conscientiousness: Industriousness and Orderliness,2016-04-01T19:28:33Z,PT1H15M46S,244563,5145,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Conscientiousness is the best predictor of long-term life success across multiple domains (including academic and managerial/administrative performance). It breaks down into two aspects: industriousness and orderliness. Industrious people are hard-working, attentive and focused. Orderly people like things where they belong, and are concerned with preserving the integrity of the borders between things. We don't know much about the psychological basis of industriousness. Orderliness, however, appears to be associated with disgust sensitivity, with the ""behavioral immune system,"" and is in all probability elevated in geographical locales where infectious disease is prevalent. It is also a good predictor of political conservatism. When disgust sensitivity gets out of hand, too much cleansing (ethnic and otherwise) becomes increasingly possible.

It has two aspects: Openness (creativity and aesthetic sensibility) and Intellect. People high in aspect openness tend to be interested in art, literature and other experiences of beauty and creativity. People high in intellect tend to be interested in ideas. Openness is the trait most highly associated with IQ, with some presuming that intellect, in particular, is merely a reflection of general cognitive ability, which is in turn an excellent predictor of many elements of life success.

Unfortunately, for many reasons, this presumption is simply incorrect. In fact, the reverse is true, insofar as social engineering is concerned: the personality and other differences between men and women MAXIMIZES instead of minimizing in exactly those societies that have moved closest to the egalitarian ideal (the Scandinavian countries). This is because those countries have eradicated most of the environmentally-produced variation in these traits, leaving only those that are genetic to manifest themselves. Sources:

Extraversion is positive emotion, roughly speaking, as Neuroticism is negative emotion (particularly anxiety and pain). Both of those emotions operate within a context provided by motivation, whose primal foundations are based in the hypothalamus.

This has had dire sociological, political and psychological consequences. It wasn't just that God died. Christ was the symbol of the perfect Western man. What died was that ideal, taking with it direction, purpose and meaning. What emerged was rational nihilism and the predilection towards resentment and authoritarian revenge.

This is partly because our minds are based in social cognition. Experience manifests itself comprehensibly as the unknown itself, the great dragon of chaos; the unknown as we experience it, the great mother; culture, the great father, and the individual, the center of conscious being, Each of these categories manifests itself in action. Each has a positive and negative element.

He combined all of these facets of his experience into a phenomenological theory of being and becoming. Rogers regarded all of human experience as equally real, as he saw the necessity of overcoming what he saw as the insufficiently comprehensive doctrine of subjective perceiver and objective reality. He believed that truth and care for his clients, along with careful listening, couldd help orient them towards self-actualization -- the key to mental health.

2016 Personality Lecture 06: Freud: An Overview,2016-02-09T21:13:21Z,PT1H18M40S,147046,2442,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Freud aggregated and synthesized centuries of speculation about the hidden realms of the human mind. For him, the individual was a collection of relatively integrated subpersonalities, some of which were centered around habits, others around memories, and the remainder around fundamental motivations and emotions. The pathway to psychological health meant furthering that integration.

However, when our plans go wrong, and we don't get what we want, what we have ignored resurfaces. If the disruption is severe enough, major parts of our identity have to be reconfigured. This can be difficult to the point of trauma.

That story contains a representation of the desired future, compared to the interpreted present. It exists at different levels of resolution, from low-res abstract ideals, down to the conscious microbehaviors that make up our actual interaction with the world. A story tells about a journey from point a to point b. A revolutionary story, a meta-story, describes how one story was transformed by anomaly and crisis into another.

It provides us with a starting place and aim. At its highest level of resolution, it is composed of voluntary behaviors. At its lowest and most abstract, it is an ultimate value. When we talk about our lenses, we are telling stories -- or, sometimes, meta-stories, when we talk about how our stories collapse or change.

A History of Violence: CBC Ideas,2015-03-21T22:55:12Z,PT53M59S,94375,1990,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"Mass murder, senseless violence, random brutality. We're all horrified by these things - yet they always seem to be with us. The human thirst for atrocity is at the heart of what psychologist Jordan Peterson has to say, in a talk he gave at the Stratford Festival, and in conversation with Paul Kennedy. Part of the answer lies in John Milton's great poem, Paradise Lost. It turns out Milton had a lot to say about our appetite for violence 350 years ago.

Women are higher in the former, men in the latter. Those differences are largest in the MOST not the LEAST egalitarian societies, in direct contradiction to the social constructionist, neo-Marxist and radical feminist claims. Conservatives are higher in politeness, a form of social convention, than liberals. Liberals are higher than conservatives in compassion.

He gave motivational factors such as lust and aggression primary places in the human psyche, and helped give clear formulation to the idea that the human psyche was made up of oft-conflicting subpersonalities. Furthermore, he was a clear observer of the pathology of the too-close, dependent family, and a great observer of and guide to dreams. For all these reasons, academic psychologists tend to hate and denigrate his achievements.

He believed that the imagination roamed where articulated knowledge had not yet voyaged, and that it was the artist and visionary who first explored new territory, civilizing it, in essence, for those who came later. The study of Jung makes the dead religious past spring back to life.

It describes how the world is portrayed in story form in myths, rituals and religious conceptualizations and how that is related to brain function and behavior. In doing so, it presents a solid alternative to nihilism and totalitarianism.

Life is about being happy, right? Just ask the Dalai Lama...or any of the best-selling authors on the subject...or the scientists who study the benefits of being happy. But are we losing something else along the way: the need for meaning in our lives? IDEAS producer Frank Faulk examines the tension between our desire for happiness and our need for meaning.

Dear Prime Minister Stephen Harper,

Canadian oceans are still not being protected. Canada currently protects 1.1% of its oceanic territory while the United States of America protects 29.4% and Australia 27.9%(1). Marine Protected Areas allow fish stocks to grow in a safe environment. Without them, fish stocks can be incessantly trawled without regenerating. The lack of oceanic protection is compromising the fishing industry, which currently employs 120 000 people(2) and exports $4.1 billion (CAD)(3) worth of goods every year.

The Atlantic Cod Fisheries have already collapsed. It was once one of the richest fishing grounds in the world. Before 1960, 300 000 tonnes of cod were landed annually on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland(3). However, there was no oceanic protection. In 1992, over 99% of the historical biomass was depleted(4). Widespread unemployment and poverty ensued with 40 000 people in the fishing industry losing their jobs(5).

Canada has repeatedly promised to protect its oceans. In 1995, Canada signed the UN Code of Conduct for Responsible Fishing Operations. In 2001, Canada signed the United Nations Agreement on Straddling and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. These treaties explicitly detail the necessary procedures to preserve fish stocks by protecting the oceans. Since then, other countries have established substantial Marine Protected Areas. Yet, only 1.1% of Canadian oceans are protected.

The University of Toronto Marine Life Advocacy is deeply concerned about the lack of oceanic protection in Canada. Marine Protected Areas are not just economic necessities, but simultaneously offer environmental and sociological benefits. The Canadian government is responsible for regulating the oceans for fishing industry, the consumers, and the general public. We would like to know why our oceans are still not protected and what might be done about it.

2014 Personality Lecture 17: Agreeableness and gender differences,2014-03-21T01:30:46Z,PT1H17M36S,92379,2175,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"There are moderate  differences in personality (and larger differences in interest) between men and women, statistically speaking, although the overlap is large, trait by trait. Agreeableness is one trait where relatively large differences exist. Associated with compassion and empathy, agreeableness is generally viewed in a positive ethical light, although there are very many ethical advantages to behavior characterized by the opposite pole. Agreeable people can easily be taken advantage of, for example -- something that happens less frequently to their disagreeable counterparts. There is also good evidence that the gender differences in personality and interest maximize, rather than minimizing, as cultures become more egalitarian. This is partly because egalitarian cultures eliminate variance in social influence, allowing the genetic differences to emerge as paramount. This is good if you think people should be allowed or even encouraged to be who they are, but not so good if you think any differences are unnecessary and bad.

*This lecture initially had some copyright issues. It was not available in several countries because of clips of 'Pinocchio' (1940). I have kept all of the lecture. This version removes the movie 'Pinocchio', so that it does not infringe on copyright. Full version also in the playlist, may be watched through a proxy server or a virtual private network.

Reality and the Sacred | TVOntario | #1,2013-05-18T04:23:45Z,PT56M35S,1232407,27201,N/A,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,"This public lecture, recorded by TVO, describes the way the world is portrayed in deep stories, such as myths and religious representations. The world in such stories is a place of action, not a place of things, and it has its archetypal characters, positive and negative. Culture is typically represented as paternal, nature as maternal, and the individual as hero and adversary. Culture offers people security, but threatens them with tyranny. Nature offers renewal, but also brings death. The religious path of meaning allows people to negotiate this archetypal landscape.
