Almost 100 people died in the Lahaina fires, the most wildfire fatalities the country has seen in a century. But months on from the event, it seems like the media and local and federal governments would rather we all forget what happened.

To uncover the truth about that day and the aftermath, including through exclusively obtained 911 calls, @theblazetv and I traveled to Maui for this first ever Blaze Original.

I am so proud to call this my first documentary and can't wait for you all to see it. All the credit in the world to Charlie Couger, Justin Gum and Tom Read for being the best team I could have asked for.

In a ghastly new trend, TikTokers are revealing where they met the people they've slept with, and for some women, it turns out their ""body counts"" are in the 30s, 40s, and even 50s... How representative are these women of the average Gen Z female, and is this what the future of dating looks like?

A video released by the Navy is causing a stir for its promotion of ""preferred pronouns"" and ""gender neutral"" language. But to anyone who's been paying attention, wokeness in the US military is nothing new, as is evident by the infamous woke army ad and numerous Pride posts from the likes of the Air Force and Space Force.

Gen Z is at it again, this time promoting ""bimboism,"" or the art of being a bimbo, on TikTok. And as shallow as it may seem, it turns out the younger generation does have some ideological motivations behind their embrace of seemingly superficial materialism, much to the dismay of the #GirlBoss feminists.

#EzraMiller is on the run and accused of concerning behavior with TWO different minors. Yet after this and a number of run-ins with the law, he still managed to star in not one, but TWO Warner Bros franchises (Fantastic Beasts and DC's cinematic universe). Why has Hollywood continue to work with him? Could it possibly be because he identifies as ""nonbinary"" and has special pronoun privilege?

More and more young people (specifically women!) are identifying as LGBT. But upon further examination, their behavior seems... curiously straight. Let's talk about the white progressives who seem to be gravitating toward the LGBT community for either politics or attention.

Comedian, actor, and YouTuber Russell Brand seems to be the target of a coordinated smear campaign, with hitpieces appearing in the Independent and Telegraph. Is there any merit to these articles, or is this just another example of legacy media trying to take down their competition?

Awkwafina has long been criticized for using what critics call a ""Blaccent,"" and for the general perceived appropriation of black culture. And now, after releasing a statement addressing the issue that only succeeded in attracting MORE negativity, the actress has chosen to remove herself from Twitter entirely.

Joe Rogan recently apologized for some past comments he made on his podcast, and Spotify has now removed 70 episodes of the show from their platform. But was this a mistake on both Rogan and Spotify's parts? Now that they've sensed weakness, what's to stop the mob from continuing their attacks?

Elon Musk has been unfiltered on Twitter defending Canadian truckers and slamming the media for mischaracterizing Joe Rogan. And while Musk is no stranger to controversy, even other celebrities, such as Dwayne Johnson and Kevin James, have also gone against the woke mob by standing by Rogan's character.

The r/antiwork subreddit recently blew up after one moderator appeared on Fox News in a disastrous interview. The ill-advised segment aside, does the group have legitimate complaints about modern-day work/life balance? Or are they merely entitled and lazy?

Actress Evangeline Lilly sparked outrage on social media after an Instagram post where she discussed attending a pro-freedom protest in DC. According to leftist echo chambers, this makes her insane and/or stupid, of course. And with all the backlash, does this put her role in Marvel's cinematic universe at risk?

One California substitute teacher took to TikTok to claim that she had gotten in trouble with a school after refusing to acknowledge one student's identity as a cat. Although no confirmation has come from any school as of yet, in a world where people can identify as whatever gender or age they fancy, is identifying as a cat really all that different?

The author joined The Young Turks (TYT) to further drive home the point that he is a big jealous crybaby who is salty that Tim is more successful than him. Cenk was similarly upset that people actually like Tim and don't downvote his videos en masse, like often happens to TYT.

Gwen Berry, hammer thrower, made headlines when she refused to stand in respect for the national anthem. Her reasoning? Apparently the anthem disrespects black people. Is she right? And regardless, are sports and The Olympics the right avenue for political activism?

According to social media, this denial is simply because she's a black woman, but the board of trustees instead points to her lack of an academic background.

Karl Marx and the labor theory of valued have been debunked by economists countless times. And yet, socialists and communists today are still convinced that profits are theft, and that ""wage labor"" is one of the great evils of capitalism. In this video, we explain how once again, socialism's greatest weakness is economics and reality.

Cash For The Homeless? Does It Affect Social Change?,2021-05-13T00:30:27Z,PT12M48S,22856,2104,N/A,Lauren Chen,UCLUrVTVTA3PnUFpYvpfMcpg,"Protect Your Retirement W/ A Gold. IRA

Homelessness is a problem that everyone wants to solve. But what's the best way to do it? Some people assert that direct cash payments, or even Universal Basic Income (UBI) can help people get back on their feet. One study even argues that such payments not only help the homeless crisis, but also reduce spending on addictive substances, but is any of that true?

In the latest example of feminist cringe and horseshoe theory, woke columnists are now promoting masks as a way to chip away at the male gaze and catcalling (now called street harassment). Feminists believe this method of preventing the objectification of women may be something new, though it's been promoted by religious communities for centuries..

The Trevor Noah reaction to Tucker Carlson's critique of current immigration policies is not only dishonest, it's also extremely hypocritical. Demographic changes and demographic transition is something that the left discusses openly, but when a conservative figure like Tucker mentions it, it suddenly morphs into a dogwhistle...

Is Kim Kardashian blackfishing? And is the popularization of mixed race beauty standards a compliment to mixed people, or problematic?

Steven Crowder's knee on neck experiment caused quite the stir, and has leftists calling for YouTube to ban him, and for advertisers to walk. After already being suspended from and demonetized on the platform, will LWC remain on YT much longer?

Bernie might be socialism's biggest advocate, but like most socialists, he doesn't have a clue what he's talking about when it comes to economics. Socialism doesn't work (and even democratic socialism is bad!), but arguments about the wealth gap still to try capitalize on people's greed. In this video, we go through some of the most common talking points in the socialism vs. capitalism debate.

The question of who cheats more men or women is a controversial one, but studies show that among younger couples, it's actually girls who are more likely to wander... In this video we look at one article that actually ENCOURAGES infidelity, and how the ""me, me, me!"" attitude is why women cheat more.

Woke ideology is surprisingly prominent, especially in publishing! In this video, we take a walk around an average bookstore, only to find SJW propaganda and woke books everywhere. Woke culture isn't just on tumblr anymore, and with gems like Antiracist Baby out there, be careful what books you're buying your kids!

In immigration news, there's a border crisis in America. Illegal border crossings and illegal immigration in general has skyrocketed under the Biden administration. It's no wonder either, since anyone who's been paying attention knows that instead of pushing reasonable immigration reform, the Democrats have been embracing open border policies for years...

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a strong supporter of the $15 minimum wage debate, and as others have pointed out, if it's possible in McDonald's workers in Denmark, why not America? In this video we look at why AOC and her #FightFor15 crew aren't seeing the big picture when it comes to the labor economy.

Is he a simp or cuck? And are we all expected to be OK with dating cam girls?

Next, Emma Watson has come out with increasingly radical feminist views that need to be addressed. And then, perhaps unsurprisingly, a Jewish Orthodox school in the U.K. is at odds with the state because they are unsatisfied with their lack of teachings about LGBT people, despite the school is completely in compliance with the laws. Lastly, the ever-wholesome TLC network is being called out for exploiting obese people - is there any legitimacy to this claim?

WORLD ENDS: Women Most Affected!?,2020-03-27T00:00:13Z,PT16M33S,64238,3662,N/A,Lauren Chen,UCLUrVTVTA3PnUFpYvpfMcpg,"Quarantine measures in Quebec are severe enough that we couldn't make our regular Wednesday night live show. That didn't stop Lauren from recording a solo long-format episode for your viewing pleasures, though! 

In this segment, Lauren focuses on one Australian senator who has found it necessary to let people know how women, actually, have been most affected in the wake up an event that is closing down entire countries. Is there any truth to this? Or is this just another cringe feminist victim game, trying to distract from the fact that (if we were to gender the problem), most of those affected would be men?

Much like the 'beta' cuttlefish, the 'male feminist' seeks to outcompete his more masculine counterparts through unconventional means… but the goal is always the same: female attention.

SEXIST Ads BANNED From UK: No Gender Stereotypes,2019-06-17T22:59:12Z,PT11M6S,46912,3296,N/A,Lauren Chen,UCLUrVTVTA3PnUFpYvpfMcpg,"The UK has taken a stand against sexism (apparently) by banning sexist gender stereotypes in commercials. Adverts with stereotypes that could be offensive won't be able to be released going forward, though some people worry about the free speech implications of such a policy. Yes, sexist ads, like those found in the past, are bad, but is banning them the right thing to do?

Also, although I talk about welfare in this video, this is NOT meant to be an argument for or against welfare. This is purely a discussion of how welfare should be handled in its current state.

What's My Gender?? | The SJW Gender Tag,2017-05-29T23:49:06Z,PT12M15S,159189,8420,N/A,Lauren Chen,UCLUrVTVTA3PnUFpYvpfMcpg,"In this video, I do the Gender Tag that has been going around the SJW community! Looking at the tag, it seems to me like social justice warriors and feminists have a very different approach to the question of ""What is gender?"" Instead of focusing on social norms and constructs, they seem to favor an a definition that emphasizes identity, pronouns expression, dysphoria and personal experience.

Should We Trust the Media? | Biased Journalism & Creative Reporting,2016-12-06T01:25:17Z,PT5M53S,73987,4575,N/A,Lauren Chen,UCLUrVTVTA3PnUFpYvpfMcpg,"In this video we’re going to look at media bias, and the way that journalists use omission and creative reporting (including source manipulation) in order to shape the public discourse and push certain narratives. Like many people, I had always assumed

Tl;dr If you ask me, you probably shouldn’t believe everything you see on the news.

Side note: This video uses Hillary Clinton’s campaign as an example of the bias and corruption in journalism, and it is a critique media collusion, not Clinton’s campaign specifically. That would be a whole different video.

"What is the Alt-Right? | Nationalism, Race & Supremacy",2016-11-29T02:51:46Z,PT10M54S,135429,6779,N/A,Lauren Chen,UCLUrVTVTA3PnUFpYvpfMcpg,"What is the alt-right? Some people have called them neo-Nazis, white supremacists, fascists, etc., but there’s not really any one solid definition of who the alt-right are and what they believe. In this video I try to explain the differences within the alt-right movement, as although all alt-righters usually espouse some form of western nationalism, what that means exactly varies from person to person.

In my opinion, the varying degrees of extremism from alt-right people relate to their adherence to pro-white nationalism, racial determinism (HBD), the desire for racially homogenous societies, white supremacy, and antisematism.

DISCLAIMER
I am not alt-right. The things I am discussing in this video are NOT my own views. Seriously. Not alt-right.

Should We Listen & Believe? | Dealing with Allegations,2016-11-21T21:12:59Z,PT5M23S,48401,4144,N/A,Lauren Chen,UCLUrVTVTA3PnUFpYvpfMcpg,"As we all remember, one of the biggest scandals to come out during this election cycle were all the women who made allegations of harassment against Donald Trump. 

That whole controversy, and the lack of evidence to substantiate the claims of misconduct, made me think of the ""listen and believe"" mentality that feminists and social justice warriors often try to promote.

If you ask me, the kind of behavior Trump was accused of is inexcusable, but it doesn't change the fact that all people are innocent until proven guilty.

John Oliver Wants YOU to Take in Syrian Refugees! | Debunking Last Week Tonight,2016-10-23T09:25:53Z,PT8M33S,173592,11292,N/A,Lauren Chen,UCLUrVTVTA3PnUFpYvpfMcpg,"This video debunks some of the claims made by John Oliver made about the Syrian Refugee Crisis and migrants in Europe on his show Last Week Tonight. Basically, there’s a lot he left out, including the economic effects of mass low-skilled immigration (huge government spending on social benefits) and the potential safety concerns. I still think he’s a funny guy though.

Should We Raise the Minimum Wage? | Poverty & Unemployment,2016-10-14T00:46:22Z,PT6M55S,92532,6132,N/A,Lauren Chen,UCLUrVTVTA3PnUFpYvpfMcpg,"No watermark? Clear audio? IS THIS EVEN A ROAMING VIDEO???
But seriously, thank you to all my amazing patrons and everyone who donated to my Paypal account. Also a ridiculous heap of gratitude to Vrbatim, who sent me my fancy new mic :)
These upgrades have made a huge difference, and they’re all thanks to you guys!

This video examines whether we should raise the minimum wage by looking at its effects on poverty, unemployment and costs for consumers. It also looks at how high minimum wages affect small businesses and big corporations differently in terms of their ability to automate. There are emotional arguments to be made for the minimum wage, but I think focusing on economics is more useful.

The internet seems to love lists, so I'm pretty much trying to get in on that cash cow hehe ;)

This looks at Black Lives Matter's anti-white racism, anti-police attitudes, tendency toward rioting, and their connection to the Movement for Black Lives.

Also, it pains my OCD deeply that this video's thumbnail doesn't match the others on my channel, but I really liked the way it looked so I decided to keep it. But whatever, I'm pretty sure no one reads these description things anyway. Still sick too, so sorry if I sound mumbly/like Brian Johnson.

Hate Speech or Free Speech? | The Dangers of Censorship,2016-09-02T13:15:15Z,PT7M16S,134887,6270,N/A,Lauren Chen,UCLUrVTVTA3PnUFpYvpfMcpg,"This video is about the debate between hate speech and freedom of speech, and why I think free speech is so important. I wanted to address this topic because one of my favorite commentators, Milo Yannopoulos, has been banned from Twitter and continually faces censorship on university campuses just for having views similar to my own.

As a freedom of speech absolutist, I disapprove of censorship, even censorship of offensive material such as hate speech (not that Milo actually engages in hate speech). I think people who advocate hate speech bans, like those we see in Germany and in safe spaces, may be doing so with the right intentions, but I don’t believe in limiting human rights, regardless of whether it protects people’s feelings.

I would have also liked to go into the ongoing YouTube demonetization thing, but that’s sort of its own problem since YouTube isn’t technically censoring people, they just disincentivizing the creation of controversial content. I’m still against what they’re doing, but it’s a more complicated issue than outright censorship.

Also I have a sore throat, so sorry that my voice sounds scratchy

"""HANDS OFF MY CULTURE!"" | The Myth of Cultural Appropriation",2016-08-19T03:55:25Z,PT7M20S,759522,47690,N/A,Lauren Chen,UCLUrVTVTA3PnUFpYvpfMcpg,"If you thought the thumbnail was offensive, you're not going to like this video.

These are my general thoughts on cultural appropriation, and I know this topic is a really sensitive one. There's way more that could be said about it than can fit into a seven minute video, but here are the main reasons why I don't believe that cultural appropriation is a major problem like some people like to paint it as.

Long story short, I think what people need to keep in mind is that offence is taken, not given. Just because you might be offended by something (like a Halloween costume), it doesn't mean it's inherently offensive to everyone. Segregating cultures will never lead to more unity in society, which is what we really need right now.

Shout out to my girls Laci Green and Franchesca Ramsey, and to MTV in general. Without them, I would have nothing to make videos about.

A Different Gender Every Day? | The Gender Fluid Issue,2016-08-06T11:00:05Z,PT5M30S,643845,30679,N/A,Lauren Chen,UCLUrVTVTA3PnUFpYvpfMcpg,"This video takes a look at some of the issues that stem from identifying as gender fluid, genderqueer, non-binary, or whatever it is the kids are calling it these days. It explores the relationship between masculinity, femininity, and gender, gender as a binary, and the use of gender-neutral pronouns like ze and hir.

Disclaimer: This video pokes fun at SJWs and tumblr-ites, but isn't in reference to anyone who actually experiences gender dysphoria.

Thanks for watching! And if you liked this, you can also check out my other video on gender:

"Paul Ryan's ""Racist"" Selfie? | My Experience as His Intern",2016-07-20T23:47:40Z,PT6M5S,189700,7991,N/A,Lauren Chen,UCLUrVTVTA3PnUFpYvpfMcpg,"Some of the interns (but apparently not many of them) in Paul Ryan's ""Speaker selfie"" were actually Democrats, but a lot of people are painting this as a specifically Republican issue. #GOPsowhite #Internssowhite

I'm pretty clearly frustrated in this video, but that's just because I hate how much race baiting there's been in pop culture lately. And I don't even like talking about partisan issues, because I think policies are more important than party affiliation, but this whole selfie thing was bugging me way too much to ignore.

Also, I know I'm definitely not good at filming myself! The lighting is worse than I thought and my phone kept falling over... But my next video will be a normal presentation-style one, another one about gender!

First-wave and second-wave feminism may have promoted gender equality, but today's radical, third-wave feminists seem to care more about encouraging man-hating than actually empowering women.
